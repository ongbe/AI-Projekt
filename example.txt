from fairest creatures we desire increase that thereby beauty's rose might never die but as the riper should by time decease his tender heir might bear his memory but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes feed'st thy light's flame with selfsubstantial fuel making a famine where abundance lies thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel thou that art now the world's fresh ornament and only herald to the gaudy spring within thine own bud buriest thy content and tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding pity the world or else this glutton be to eat the world's due by the grave and thee when forty winters shall besiege thy brow and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held  then being asked where all thy beauty lies where all the treasure of thy lusty days  to say within thine own deep sunken eyes were an alleating shame and thriftless praise how much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use if thou couldst answer 'this fair child of mine shall sum my count and make my old excuse' proving his beauty by succession thine this were to be new made when thou art old and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest now is the time that face should form another whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother for where is she so fair whose unear'd womb disdains the tillage of thy husbandry or who is he so fond will be the tomb of his selflove to stop posterity  thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee calls back the lovely april of her prime so thou through windows of thine age shalt see despite of wrinkles this thy golden time but if thou live remember'd not to be die single and thine image dies with thee unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend upon thy self thy beauty's legacy nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend and being frank she lends to those are free then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse the bounteous largess given thee to give profitless usurer why dost thou use so great a sum of sums yet canst not live for having traffic with thy self alone thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive then how when nature calls thee to be gone what acceptable audit canst thou leave thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee which used lives th' executor to be those hours that with gentle work did frame the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell will play the tyrants to the very same and that unfair which fairly doth excel for neverresting time leads summer on to hideous winter and confounds him there sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone beauty o'ersnowed and bareness every where then were not summer's distillation left a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass beauty's effect with beauty were bereft nor it nor no remembrance what it was but flowers distill'd though they with winter meet leese but their show their substance still lives sweet then let not winter's ragged hand deface in thee thy summer ere thou be distill'd make sweet some vial treasure thou some place with beauty's treasure ere it be selfkill'd that use is not forbidden usury which happies those that pay the willing loan that's for thy self to breed another thee or ten times happier be it ten for one ten times thy self were happier than thou art if ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee then what could death do if thou shouldst depart leaving thee living in posterity be not selfwill'd for thou art much too fair to be death's conquest and make worms thine heir lo in the orient when the gracious light lifts up his burning head each under eye doth homage to his newappearing sight serving with looks his sacred majesty  and having climb'd the steepup heavenly hill resembling strong youth in his middle age yet mortal looks adore his beauty still attending on his golden pilgrimage but when from highmost pitch with weary car like feeble age he reeleth from the day the eyes 'fore duteous now converted are from his low tract and look another way so thou thyself outgoing in thy noon unlook'd on diest unless thou get a son music to hear why hear'st thou music sadly sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy if the true concord of welltuned sounds by unions married do offend thine ear they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear  mark how one string sweet husband to another strikes each in each by mutual ordering resembling sire and child and happy mother who all in one one pleasing note do sing whose speechless song being many seeming one sings this to thee 'thou single wilt prove none' is it for fear to wet a widow's eye that thou consum'st thy self in single life ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die the world will wail thee like a makeless wife the world will be thy widow and still weep that thou no form of thee hast left behind when every private widow well may keep by children's eyes her husband's shape in mind look what an unthrift in the world doth spend shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it but beauty's waste hath in the world an end and kept unused the user so destroys it no love toward others in that bosom sits that on himself such murd'rous shame commits for shame deny that thou bear'st love to any who for thy self art so unprovident grant if thou wilt thou art belov'd of many but that thou none lov'st is most evident for thou art so possess'd with murderous hate that 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate which to repair should be thy chief desire o change thy thought that i may change my mind shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love be as thy presence is gracious and kind or to thyself at least kindhearted prove make thee another self for love of me that beauty still may live in thine or thee as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st in one of thine from that which thou departest and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest herein lives wisdom beauty and increase without this folly age and cold decay if all were minded so the times should cease and threescore year would make the world away let those whom nature hath not made for store harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish look whom she best endow'd she gave thee more which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish she carv'd thee for her seal and meant thereby thou shouldst print more not let that copy die when i do count the clock that tells the time and see the brave day sunk in hideous night when i behold the violet past prime and sable curls all silvered o'er with white  when lofty trees i see barren of leaves which erst from heat did canopy the herd and summer's green all girded up in sheaves borne on the bier with white and bristly beard then of thy beauty do i question make that thou among the wastes of time must go since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake and die as fast as they see others grow and nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defence save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence o that you were your self but love you are no longer yours than you your self here live against this coming end you should prepare and your sweet semblance to some other give so should that beauty which you hold in lease find no determination then you were yourself again after yourself's decease when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear  who lets so fair a house fall to decay which husbandry in honour might uphold against the stormy gusts of winter's day and barren rage of death's eternal cold o none but unthrifts dear my love you know you had a father let your son say so not from the stars do i my judgement pluck and yet methinks i have astronomy but not to tell of good or evil luck of plagues of dearths or seasons' quality nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell pointing to each his thunder rain and wind or say with princes if it shall go well by oft predict that i in heaven find but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive and constant stars in them i read such art as 'truth and beauty shall together thrive if from thyself to store thou wouldst convert'  or else of thee this i prognosticate 'thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date' when i consider every thing that grows holds in perfection but a little moment that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows whereon the stars in secret influence comment when i perceive that men as plants increase cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease and wear their brave state out of memory then the conceit of this inconstant stay sets you most rich in youth before my sight where wasteful time debateth with decay to change your day of youth to sullied night and all in war with time for love of you as he takes from you i engraft you new but wherefore do not you a mightier way make war upon this bloody tyrant time and fortify your self in your decay with means more blessed than my barren rhyme now stand you on the top of happy hours and many maiden gardens yet unset with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers much liker than your painted counterfeit so should the lines of life that life repair which this time's pencil or my pupil pen neither in inward worth nor outward fair can make you live your self in eyes of men to give away yourself keeps yourself still and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill who will believe my verse in time to come if it were fill'd with your most high deserts though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb which hides your life and shows not half your parts  if i could write the beauty of your eyes and in fresh numbers number all your graces the age to come would say 'this poet lies such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces' so should my papers yellow'd with their age be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue and your true rights be term'd a poet's rage and stretched metre of an antique song but were some child of yours alive that time you should live twicein it and in my rhyme shall i compare thee to a summer's day thou art more lovely and more temperate rough winds do shake the darling buds of may and summer's lease hath all too short a date sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines and often is his gold complexion dimm'd and every fair from fair sometime declines by chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd  but thy eternal summer shall not fade nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st so long as men can breathe or eyes can see so long lives this and this gives life to thee devouring time blunt thou the lion's paws and make the earth devour her own sweet brood pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws and burn the longliv'd phoenix in her blood make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets and do whate'er thou wilt swiftfooted time to the wide world and all her fading sweets but i forbid thee one most heinous crime o carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen him in thy course untainted do allow for beauty's pattern to succeeding men  yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong my love shall in my verse ever live young a woman's face with nature's own hand painted hast thou the master mistress of my passion a woman's gentle heart but not acquainted with shifting change as is false women's fashion an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling gilding the object whereupon it gazeth a man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth and for a woman wert thou first created till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting and by addition me of thee defeated by adding one thing to my purpose nothing but since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure so is it not with me as with that muse stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse who heaven itself for ornament doth use and every fair with his fair doth rehearse making a couplement of proud compare' with sun and moon with earth and sea's rich gems with april's firstborn flowers and all things rare that heaven's air in this huge rondure hems o let me true in love but truly write and then believe me my love is as fair as any mother's child though not so bright as those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air let them say more that like of hearsay well i will not praise that purpose not to sell my glass shall not persuade me i am old so long as youth and thou are of one date but when in thee time's furrows i behold then look i death my days should expiate  for all that beauty that doth cover thee is but the seemly raiment of my heart which in thy breast doth live as thine in me how can i then be elder than thou art o therefore love be of thyself so wary as i not for myself but for thee will bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary as tender nurse her babe from faring ill presume not on thheart when mine is slain thou gav'st me thine not to give back again as an unperfect actor on the stage who with his fear is put beside his part or some fierce thing replete with too much rage whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart so i for fear of trust forget to say the perfect ceremony of love's rite and in mine own love's strength seem to decay o'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might  o let my looks be then the eloquence and dumb presagers of my speaking breast who plead for love and look for recompense more than that tongue that more hath more express'd o learn to read what silent love hath writ to hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd thy beauty's form in table of my heart my body is the frame wherein 'tis held and perspective it is best painter's art for through the painter must you see his skill to find where your true image pictur'd lies which in my bosom's shop is hanging still that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun delights to peep to gaze therein on thee  yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art they draw but what they see know not the heart let those who are in favour with their stars of public honour and proud titles boast whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars unlook'd for joy in that i honour most great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread but as the marigold at the sun's eye and in themselves their pride lies buried for at a frown they in their glory die the painful warrior famoused for fight after a thousand victories once foil'd is from the book of honour razed quite and all the rest forgot for which he toil'd then happy i that love and am belov'd where i may not remove nor be remov'd lord of my love to whom in vassalage thy merit hath my duty strongly knit to thee i send this written embassage to witness duty not to show my wit duty so great which wit so poor as mine may make seem bare in wanting words to show it but that i hope some good conceit of thine in thy soul's thought all naked will bestow it till whatsoever star that guides my moving points on me graciously with fair aspect and puts apparel on my tatter'd loving to show me worthy of thy sweet respect then may i dare to boast how i do love thee till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me weary with toil i haste me to my bed the dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd but then begins a journey in my head to work my mind when body's work's expired  for then my thoughtsfrom far where i abide intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee and keep my drooping eyelids open wide looking on darkness which the blind do see save that my soul's imaginary sight presents thy shadow to my sightless view which like a jewel hung in ghastly night makes black night beauteous and her old face new lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind for thee and for myself no quiet find how can i then return in happy plight that am debarre'd the benefit of rest when day's oppression is not eas'd by night but day by night and night by day oppress'd and each though enemies to either's reign do in consent shake hands to torture me the one by toil the other to complain how far i toil still farther off from thee  i tell the day to please him thou art bright and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven so flatter i the swartcomplexion'd night when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer and night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger when in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes i all alone beweep my outcast state and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries and look upon myself and curse my fate wishing me like to one more rich in hope featur'd like him like him with friends possess'd desiring this man's art and that man's scope with what i most enjoy contented least yet in these thoughts my self almost despising haply i think on thee and then my state like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate for thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings that then i scorn to change my state with kings when to the sessions of sweet silent thought i summon up remembrance of things past i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste then can i drown an eye unused to flow for precious friends hid in death's dateless night and weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe and moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight then can i grieve at grievances foregone and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er the sad account of forebemoaned moan which i new pay as if not paid before but if the while i think on thee dear friend all losses are restor'd and sorrows end thy bosom is endeared with all hearts which i by lacking have supposed dead and there reigns love and all love's loving parts and all those friends which i thought buried how many a holy and obsequious tear hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye as interest of the dead which now appear but things remov'd that hidden in thee lie thou art the grave where buried love doth live hung with the trophies of my lovers gone who all their parts of me to thee did give that due of many now is thine alone their images i lov'd i view in thee and thouall theyhast all the all of me if thou survive my wellcontented day when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover and shalt by fortune once more resurvey these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover compare them with the bett'ring of the time and though they be outstripp'd by every pen reserve them for my love not for their rhyme exceeded by the height of happier men o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought 'had my friend's muse grown with this growing age a dearer birth than this his love had brought to march in ranks of better equipage but since he died and poets better prove theirs for their style i'll read his for his love' full many a glorious morning have i seen flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye kissing with golden face the meadows green gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy anon permit the basest clouds to ride with ugly rack on his celestial face and from the forlorn world his visage hide stealing unseen to west with this disgrace  even so my sun one early morn did shine with all triumphant splendour on my brow but out alack he was but one hour mine the region cloud hath mask'd him from me now yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth why didst thou promise such a beauteous day and make me travel forth without my cloak to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke 'tis not enough that through the cloud thou break to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face for no man well of such a salve can speak that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace nor can thy shame give physic to my grief though thou repent yet i have still the loss the offender's sorrow lends but weak relief to him that bears the strong offence's cross  ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds no more be griev'd at that which thou hast done roses have thorns and silver fountains mud clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud all men make faults and even i in this authorizing thy trespass with compare myself corrupting salving thy amiss excusing thy sins more than thy sins are for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense thy adverse party is thy advocate and 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence such civil war is in my love and hate that i an accessary needs must be to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me let me confess that we two must be twain although our undivided loves are one so shall those blots that do with me remain without thy help by me be borne alone in our two loves there is but one respect though in our lives a separable spite which though it alter not love's sole effect yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight i may not evermore acknowledge thee lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame nor thou with public kindness honour me unless thou take that honour from thy name but do not so i love thee in such sort as thou being mine mine is thy good report as a decrepit father takes delight to see his active child do deeds of youth so i made lame by fortune's dearest spite take all my comfort of thy worth and truth  for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit or any of these all or all or more entitled in thy parts do crowned sit i make my love engrafted to this store so then i am not lame poor nor despis'd whilst that this shadow doth such substance give that i in thy abundance am suffic'd and by a part of all thy glory live look what is best that best i wish in thee this wish i have then ten times happy me how can my muse want subject to invent while thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse thine own sweet argument too excellent for every vulgar paper to rehearse o give thy self the thanks if aught in me worthy perusal stand against thy sight for who's so dumb that cannot write to thee when thou thy self dost give invention light  be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth than those old nine which rhymers invocate and he that calls on thee let him bring forth eternal numbers to outlive long date if my slight muse do please these curious days the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise o how thy worth with manners may i sing when thou art all the better part of me what can mine own praise to mine own self bring and what is't but mine own when i praise thee even for this let us divided live and our dear love lose name of single one that by this separation i may give that due to thee which thou deserv'st alone o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave to entertain the time with thoughts of love which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive  and that thou teachest how to make one twain by praising him here who doth hence remain take all my loves my love yea take them all what hast thou then more than thou hadst before no love my love that thou mayst true love call all mine was thine before thou hadst this more then if for my love thou my love receivest i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest but yet be blam'd if thou thy self deceivest by wilful taste of what thyself refusest i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief although thou steal thee all my poverty and yet love knows it is a greater grief to bear love's wrong than hate's known injury lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows kill me with spites yet we must not be foes those pretty wrongs that liberty commits when i am sometime absent from thy heart thy beauty and thy years full well befits for still temptation follows where thou art gentle thou art and therefore to be won beauteous thou art therefore to be assail'd and when a woman woos what woman's son will sourly leave her till he have prevail'd ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth who lead thee in their riot even there where thou art forced to break a twofold truth hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee thine by thy beauty being false to me that thou hast her it is not all my grief and yet it may be said i loved her dearly that she hath thee is of my wailing chief a loss in love that touches me more nearly  loving offenders thus i will excuse ye thou dost love her because thou know'st i love her and for my sake even so doth she abuse me suffering my friend for my sake to approve her if i lose thee my loss is my love's gain and losing her my friend hath found that loss both find each other and i lose both twain and both for my sake lay on me this cross but here's the joy my friend and i are one sweet flattery then she loves but me alone when most i wink then do mine eyes best see for all the day they view things unrespected but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee and darkly bright are bright in dark directed then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright how would thy shadow's form form happy show to the clear day with thy much clearer light when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so  how would i say mine eyes be blessed made by looking on thee in the living day when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay all days are nights to see till i see thee and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me if the dull substance of my flesh were thought injurious distance should not stop my way for then despite of space i would be brought from limits far remote where thou dost stay no matter then although my foot did stand upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee for nimble thought can jump both sea and land as soon as think the place where he would be but ah thought kills me that i am not thought to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone but that so much of earth and water wrought i must attend time's leisure with my moan receiving nought by elements so slow but heavy tears badges of either's woe the other two slight air and purging fire are both with thee wherever i abide the first my thought the other my desire these presentabsent with swift motion slide for when these quicker elements are gone in tender embassy of love to thee my life being made of four with two alone sinks down to death oppress'd with melancholy until life's composition be recur'd by those swift messengers return'd from thee who even but now come back again assur'd of thy fair health recounting it to me this told i joy but then no longer glad i send them back again and straight grow sad mine eye and heart are at a mortal war how to divide the conquest of thy sight mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar my heart mine eye the freedom of that right my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie a closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes but the defendant doth that plea deny and says in him thy fair appearance lies to side this title is impannelled a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart and by their verdict is determined the clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part as thus mine eye's due is thy outward part and my heart's right thy inward love of heart betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took and each doth good turns now unto the other when that mine eye is famish'd for a look or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother with my love's picture then my eye doth feast and to the painted banquet bids my heart another time mine eye is my heart's guest and in his thoughts of love doth share a part so either by thy picture or my love thy self away art present still with me for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move and i am still with them and they with thee or if they sleep thy picture in my sight awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight how careful was i when i took my way each trifle under truest bars to thrust that to my use it might unused stay from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust but thou to whom my jewels trifles are most worthy comfort now my greatest grief thou best of dearest and mine only care art left the prey of every vulgar thief  thee have i not lock'd up in any chest save where thou art not though i feel thou art within the gentle closure of my breast from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part and even thence thou wilt be stol'n i fear for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear against that time if ever that time come when i shall see thee frown on my defects when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum call'd to that audit by advis'd respects against that time when thou shalt strangely pass and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye when love converted from the thing it was shall reasons find of settled gravity against that time do i ensconce me here within the knowledge of mine own desert and this my hand against my self uprear to guard the lawful reasons on thy part  to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws since why to love i can allege no cause how heavy do i journey on the way when what i seek my weary travel's end doth teach that ease and that repose to say 'thus far the miles are measured from thy friend' the beast that bears me tired with my woe plods dully on to bear that weight in me as if by some instinct the wretch did know his rider lov'd not speed being made from thee the bloody spur cannot provoke him on that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide which heavily he answers with a groan more sharp to me than spurring to his side for that same groan doth put this in my mind my grief lies onward and my joy behind thus can my love excuse the slow offence of my dull bearer when from thee i speed from where thou art why should i haste me thence till i return of posting is no need o what excuse will my poor beast then find when swift extremity can seem but slow then should i spur though mounted on the wind in winged speed nmotion shall i know then can no horse with my desire keep pace therefore desire of perfect'st love being made shall neighno dull fleshin his fiery race but love for love thus shall excuse my jade 'since from thee going he went wilfulslow towards thee i'll run and give him leave to go' so am i as the rich whose blessed key can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure the which he will not every hour survey for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure  therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare since seldom coming in that long year set like stones of worth they thinly placed are or captain jewels in the carcanet so is the time that keeps you as my chest or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide to make some special instant specialblest by new unfolding his imprison'd pride blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope being had to triumph being lacked to hope what is your substance whereof are you made that millions of strange shadows on you tend since every one hath every one one shade and you but one can every shadow lend describe adonis and the counterfeit is poorly imitated after you on helen's cheek all art of beauty set and you in grecian tires are painted new  speak of the spring and foison of the year the one doth shadow of your beauty show the other as your bounty doth appear and you in every blessed shape we know in all external grace you have some part but you like none none you for constant heart o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem by that sweet ornament which truth doth give the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem for that sweet odour which doth in it live the canker blooms have full as deep a dye as the perfumed tincture of the roses hang on such thorns and play as wantonly when summer's breath their masked buds discloses but for their virtue only is their show they live unwoo'd and unrespected fade die to themselves sweet roses do not so of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made  and so of you beauteous and lovely youth when that shall vade by verse distills your truth not marble nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme but you shall shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time when wasteful war shall statues overturn and broils root out the work of masonry nor mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn the living record of your memory 'gainst death and alloblivious enmity shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room even in the eyes of all posterity that wear this world out to the ending doom so till the judgment that yourself arise you live in this and dwell in lovers' eyes sweet love renew thy force be it not said thy edge should blunter be than appetite which but today by feeding is allay'd tomorrow sharpened in his former might so love be thou although today thou fill thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness tomorrow see again and do not kill the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness let this sad interim like the ocean be which parts the shore where two contracted new come daily to the banks that when they see return of love more blest may be the view or call it winter which being full of care makes summer's welcome thrice more wished more rare being your slave what should i do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire i have no precious time at all to spend nor services to do till you require  nor dare i chide the worldwithoutend hour whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you nor think the bitterness of absence sour when you have bid your servant once adieu nor dare i question with my jealous thought where you may be or your affairs suppose but like a sad slave stay and think of nought save where you are how happy you make those so true a fool is love that in your will though you do anything he thinks no ill that god forbid that made me first your slave i should in thought control your times of pleasure or at your hand the account of hours to crave being your vassal bound to stay your leisure o let me suffer being at your beck the imprison'd absence of your liberty and patience tame to sufferance bide each check without accusing you of injury  be where you list your charter is so strong that you yourself may privilage your time to what you will to you it doth belong yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime i am to wait though waiting so be hell not blame your pleasure be it ill or well if there be nothing new but that which is hath been before how are our brains beguil'd which labouring for invention bear amiss the second burthen of a former child o that record could with a backward look even of five hundred courses of the sun show me your image in some antique book since mind at first in character was done that i might see what the old world could say to this composed wonder of your frame wh'r we are mended or wh'r better they or whether revolution be the same  o sure i am the wits of former days to subjects worse have given admiring praise like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore so do our minutes hasten to their end each changing place with that which goes before in sequent toil all forwards do contend nativity once in the main of light crawls to maturity wherewith being crown'd crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight and time that gave doth now his gift confound time doth transfix the flourish set on youth and delves the parallels in beauty's brow feeds on the rarities of nature's truth and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand praising thy worth despite his cruel hand is it thy will thy image should keep open my heavy eyelids to the weary night dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken while shadows like to thee do mock my sight is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee so far from home into my deeds to pry to find out shames and idle hours in me the scope and tenure of thy jealousy o no thy love though much is not so great it is my love that keeps mine eye awake mine own true love that doth my rest defeat to play the watchman ever for thy sake for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere from me far off with others all too near sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye and all my soul and all my every part and for this sin there is no remedy it is so grounded inward in my heart methinks no face so gracious is as mine no shape so true no truth of such account and for myself mine own worth do define as i all other in all worths surmount but when my glass shows me myself indeed beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity mine own selflove quite contrary i read self so selfloving were iniquity 'tis theemyselfthat for myself i praise painting my age with beauty of thy days against my love shall be as i am now with time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn when hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn hath travell'd on to age's steepy night and all those beauties whereof now he's king are vanishing or vanished out of sight stealing away the treasure of his spring  for such a time do i now fortify against confounding age's cruel knife that he shall never cut from memory my sweet love's beauty though my lover's life his beauty shall in these black lines be seen and they shall live and he in them still green when i have seen by time's fell hand defac'd the richproud cost of outworn buried age when sometime lofty towers i see downraz'd and brass eternal slave to mortal rage when i have seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore and the firm soil win of the watery main increasing store with loss and loss with store when i have seen such interchange of state or state itself confounded to decay ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate that time will come and take my love away  this thought is as a death which cannot choose but weep to have that which it fears to lose since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea but sad mortality o'ersways their power how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea whose action is no stronger than a flower o how shall summer's honey breath hold out against the wrackful siege of battering days when rocks impregnable are not so stout nor gates of steel so strong but time decays o fearful meditation where alack shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back or who his spoil of beauty can forbid o none unless this miracle have might that in black ink my love may still shine bright tired with all these for restful death i cry as to behold desert a beggar born and needy nothing trimm'd in jollity and purest faith unhappily forsworn and gilded honour shamefully misplac'd and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted and right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd and strength by limping sway disabled and art made tonguetied by authority and follydoctorlikecontrolling skill and simple truth miscall'd simplicity and captive good attending captain ill tir'd with all these from these would i be gone save that to die i leave my love alone ah wherefore with infection should he live and with his presence grace impiety that sin by him advantage should achieve and lace itself with his society  why should false painting imitate his cheek and steel dead seeming of his living hue why should poor beauty indirectly seek roses of shadow since his rose is true why should he live now nature bankrupt is beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins for she hath no exchequer now but his and proud of many lives upon his gains o him she stores to show what wealth she had in days long since before these last so bad thus is his cheek the map of days outworn when beauty lived and died as flowers do now before these bastard signs of fair were born or durst inhabit on a living brow before the golden tresses of the dead the right of sepulchres were shorn away to live a second life on second head ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay  in him those holy antique hours are seen without all ornament itself and true making no summer of another's green robbing no old to dress his beauty new and him as for a map doth nature store to show false art what beauty was of yore those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend all tonguesthe voice of soulsgive thee that due uttering bare truth even so as foes commend thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd but those same tongues that give thee so thine own in other accents do this praise confound by seeing farther than the eye hath shown they look into the beauty of thy mind and that in guess they measure by thy deeds thenchurlstheir thoughts although their eyes were kind to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds  but why thy odour matcheth not thy show the soil is this that thou dost common grow that thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect for slander's mark was ever yet the fair the ornament of beauty is suspect a crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air so thou be good slander doth but approve thy worth the greater being woo'd of time for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love and thou present'st a pure unstained prime thou hast passed by the ambush of young days either not assail'd or victor being charg'd yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise to tie up envy evermore enlarg'd if some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe no longer mourn for me when i am dead than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell nay if you read this line remember not the hand that writ it for i love you so that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot if thinking on me then should make you woe o ifi say you look upon this verse when i perhaps compounded am with clay do not so much as my poor name rehearse but let your love even with my life decay lest the wise world should look into your moan and mock you with me after i am gone o lest the world should task you to recite what merit lived in me that you should love after my deathdear love forget me quite for you in me can nothing worthy prove unless you would devise some virtuous lie to do more for me than mine own desert and hang more praise upon deceased i than niggard truth would willingly impart o lest your true love may seem false in this that you for love speak well of me untrue my name be buried where my body is and live no more to shame nor me nor you for i am shamed by that which i bring forth and so should you to love things nothing worth that time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leaves or none or few do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold bare ruin'd choirs where late the sweet birds sang in me thou see'st the twilight of such day as after sunset fadeth in the west which by and by black night doth take away death's second self that seals up all in rest  in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire that on the ashes of his youth doth lie as the deathbed whereon it must expire consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by this thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more strong to love that well which thou must leave ere long but be contented when that fell arrest without all bail shall carry me away my life hath in this line some interest which for memorial still with thee shall stay when thou reviewest this thou dost review the very part was consecrate to thee the earth can have but earth which is his due my spirit is thine the better part of me so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life the prey of worms my body being dead the coward conquest of a wretch's knife too base of thee to be remembered the worth of that is that which it contains and that is this and this with thee remains so are you to my thoughts as food to life or as sweetseason'd showers are to the ground and for the peace of you i hold such strife as 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found now proud as an enjoyer and anon doubting the filching age will steal his treasure now counting best to be with you alone then better'd that the world may see my pleasure sometime all full with feasting on your sight and by and by clean starved for a look possessing or pursuing no delight save what is had or must from you be took thus do i pine and surfeit day by day or gluttoning on all or all away why is my verse so barren of new pride so far from variation or quick change why with the time do i not glance aside to newfound methods and to compounds strange why write i still all one ever the same and keep invention in a noted weed that every word doth almost tell my name showing their birth and where they did proceed o know sweet love i always write of you and you and love are still my argument so all my best is dressing old words new spending again what is already spent for as the sun is daily new and old so is my love still telling what is told thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear thy dial how thy precious minutes waste these vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear and of this book this learning mayst thou taste  the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show of mouthed graves will give thee memory thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know time's thievish progress to eternity look what thy memory cannot contain commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find those children nursed deliver'd from thy brain to take a new acquaintance of thy mind these offices so oft as thou wilt look shall profit thee and much enrich thy book so oft have i invoked thee for my muse and found such fair assistance in my verse as every alien pen hath got my use and under thee their poesy disperse thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing and heavy ignorance aloft to fly have added feathers to the learned's wing and given grace a double majesty yet be most proud of that which i compile whose influence is thine and born of thee in others' works thou dost but mend the style and arts with thy sweet graces graced be but thou art all my art and dost advance as high as learning my rude ignorance whilst i alone did call upon thy aid my verse alone had all thy gentle grace but now my gracious numbers are decay'd and my sick muse doth give an other place i grant sweet love thy lovely argument deserves the travail of a worthier pen yet what of thee thy poet doth invent he robs thee of and pays it thee again he lends thee virtue and he stole that word from thy behaviour beauty doth he give and found it in thy cheek he can afford no praise to thee but what in thee doth live  then thank him not for that which he doth say since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay o how i faint when i of you do write knowing a better spirit doth use your name and in the praise thereof spends all his might to make me tonguetied speaking of your fame but since your worthwide as the ocean is the humble as the proudest sail doth bear my saucy bark inferior far to his on your broad main doth wilfully appear your shallowest help will hold me up afloat whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride or being wrack'd i am a worthless boat he of tall building and of goodly pride then if he thrive and i be cast away the worst was thismy love was my decay or i shall live your epitaph to make or you survive when i in earth am rotten from hence your memory death cannot take although in me each part will be forgotten your name from hence immortal life shall have though i once gone to all the world must die the earth can yield me but a common grave when you entombed in men's eyes shall lie your monument shall be my gentle verse which eyes not yet created shall o'erread and tongues to be your being shall rehearse when all the breathers of this world are dead you still shall livesuch virtue hath my pen where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men i grant thou wert not married to my muse and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook the dedicated words which writers use of their fair subject blessing every book  thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue finding thy worth a limit past my praise and therefore art enforced to seek anew some fresher stamp of the timebettering days and do so love yet when they have devis'd what strained touches rhetoric can lend thou truly fair wert truly sympathiz'd in true plain words by thy truetelling friend and their gross painting might be better us'd where cheeks need blood in thee it is abus'd i never saw that you did painting need and therefore to your fair no painting set i found or thought i found you did exceed that barren tender of a poet's debt and therefore have i slept in your report that you yourself being extant well might show how far a modern quill doth come too short speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow  this silence for my sin you did impute which shall be most my glory being dumb for i impair not beauty being mute when others would give life and bring a tomb there lives more life in one of your fair eyes than both your poets can in praise devise who is it that says most which can say more than this rich praisethat you alone are you in whose confine immured is the store which should example where your equal grew lean penury within that pen doth dwell that to his subject lends not some small glory but he that writes of you if he can tell that you are you so dignifies his story let him but copy what in you is writ not making worse what nature made so clear and such a counterpart shall fame his wit making his style admired every where you to your beauteous blessings add a curse being fond on praise which makes your praises worse my tonguetied muse in manners holds her still while comments of your praise richly compil'd reserve their character with golden quill and precious phrase by all the muses fil'd i think good thoughts whilst others write good words and like unlettered clerk still cry 'amen' to every hymn that able spirit affords in polish'd form of wellrefined pen hearing you praised i say ''tis so 'tis true' and to the most of praise add something more but that is in my thought whose love to you though words come hindmost holds his rank before then others for the breath of words respect me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect was it the proud full sail of his great verse bound for the prize of all too precious you that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse making their tomb the womb wherein they grew was it his spirit by spirits taught to write above a mortal pitch that struck me dead no neither he nor his compeers by night giving him aid my verse astonished he nor that affable familiar ghost which nightly gulls him with intelligence as victors of my silence cannot boast i was not sick of any fear from thence but when your countenance fill'd up his line then lacked i matter that enfeebled mine farewell thou art too dear for my possessing and like enough thou know'st thy estimate the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing my bonds in thee are all determinate for how do i hold thee but by thy granting and for that riches where is my deserving the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting and so my patent back again is swerving thy self thou gav'st thy own worth then not knowing or me to whom thou gav'st it else mistaking so thy great gift upon misprision growing comes home again on better judgement making thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter in sleep a king but waking no such matter when thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light and place my merit in the eye of scorn upon thy side against myself i'll fight and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn with mine own weakness being best acquainted upon thy part i can set down a story of faults conceal'd wherein i am attainted that thou in losing me shalt win much glory  and i by this will be a gainer too for bending all my loving thoughts on thee the injuries that to myself i do doing thee vantage doublevantage me such is my love to thee i so belong that for thy right myself will bear all wrong say that thou didst forsake me for some fault and i will comment upon that offence speak of my lameness and i straight will halt against thy reasons making no defence thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill to set a form upon desired change as i'll myself disgrace knowing thy will i will acquaintance strangle and look strange be absent from thy walks and in my tongue thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell lest i too much profane should do it wrong and haply of our old acquaintance tell  for thee against my self i'll vow debate for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate then hate me when thou wilt if ever now now while the world is bent my deeds to cross join with the spite of fortune make me bow and do not drop in for an afterloss ah do not when my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe give not a windy night a rainy morrow to linger out a purpos'd overthrow if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last when other petty griefs have done their spite but in the onset come so shall i taste at first the very worst of fortune's might and other strains of woe which now seem woe compar'd with loss of thee will not seem so some glory in their birth some in their skill some in their wealth some in their body's force some in their garments though newfangled ill some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure wherein it finds a joy above the rest but these particulars are not my measure all these i better in one general best thy love is better than high birth to me richer than wealth prouder than garments' costs of more delight than hawks and horses be and having thee of all men's pride i boast wretched in this alone that thou mayst take all this away and me most wretchcd make but do thy worst to steal thyself away for term of life thou art assured mine and life no longer than thy love will stay for it depends upon that love of thine  then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs when in the least of them my life hath end i see a better state to me belongs than that which on thy humour doth depend thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind since that my life on thy revolt doth lie o what a happy title do i find happy to have thy love happy to die but what's so blessedfair that fears no blot thou mayst be false and yet i know it not so shall i live supposing thou art true like a deceived husband so love's face may still seem love to me though alter'd new thy looks with me thy heart in other place for there can live no hatred in thine eye therefore in that i cannot know thy change in many's looks the false heart's history is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange  but heaven in thy creation did decree that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell how like eve's apple doth thy beauty grow if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show they that have power to hurt and will do none that do not do the thing they most do show who moving others are themselves as stone unmoved cold and to temptation slow they rightly do inherit heaven's graces and husband nature's riches from expense they are the lords and owners of their faces others but stewards of their excellence the summer's flower is to the summer sweet though to itself it only live and die but if that flower with base infection meet the basest weed outbraves his dignity  for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame which like a canker in the fragrant rose doth spot the beauty of thy budding name o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose that tongue that tells the story of thy days making lascivious comments on thy sport cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise naming thy name blesses an ill report o what a mansion have those vices got which for their habitation chose out thee where beauty's veil doth cover every blot and all things turns to fair that eyes can see take heed dear heart of this large privilege the hardest knife illus'd doth lose his edge some say thy fault is youth some wantonness some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort as on the finger of a throned queen the basest jewel will be well esteem'd so are those errors that in thee are seen to truths translated and for true things deem'd how many lambs might the stern wolf betray if like a lamb he could his looks translate how many gazers mightst thou lead away if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state but do not so i love thee in such sort as thou being mine mine is thy good report how like a winter hath my absence been from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year what freezings have i felt what dark days seen what old december's bareness everywhere  and yet this time removed was summer's time the teeming autumn big with rich increase bearing the wanton burden of the prime like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease yet this abundant issue seem'd to me but hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit for summer and his pleasures wait on thee and thou away the very birds are mute or if they sing 'tis with so dull a cheer that leaves look pale dreading the winter's near from you have i been absent in the spring when proudpied april dress'd in all his trim hath put a spirit of youth in every thing that heavy saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell of different flowers in odour and in hue could make me any summer's story tell or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew  nor did i wonder at the lily's white nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose they were but sweet but figures of delight drawn after you you pattern of all those yet seem'd it winter still and you away as with your shadow i with these did play the forward violet thus did i chide sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells if not from my love's breath the purple pride which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd the lily i condemned for thy hand and buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair the roses fearfully on thorns did stand one blushing shame another white despair a third nor red nor white had stol'n of both and to his robbery had annex'd thy breath but for his theft in pride of all his growth  a vengeful canker eat him up to death more flowers i noted yet i none could see but sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee where art thou muse that thou forget'st so long to speak of that which gives thee all thy might spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song darkening thy power to lend base subjects light return forgetful muse and straight redeem in gentle numbers time so idly spent sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem and gives thy pen both skill and argument rise resty muse my love's sweet face survey if time have any wrinkle graven there if any be a satire to decay and make time's spoils despised every where give my love fame faster than time wastes life so thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife o truant muse what shall be thy amends for thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd both truth and beauty on my love depends so dost thou too and therein dignified make answer muse wilt thou not haply say 'truth needs no colour with his colour fix'd beauty no pencil beauty's truth to lay but best is best if never intermix'd' because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb excuse not silence so for't lies in thee to make him much outlive a gilded tomb and to be prais'd of ages yet to be then do thy office muse i teach thee how to make him seem long hence as he shows now my love is strengthen'd though more weak in seeming i love not less though less the show appear that love is merchandiz'd whose rich esteeming the owner's tongue doth publish every where our love was new and then but in the spring when i was wont to greet it with my lays as philomel in summer's front doth sing and stops her pipe in growth of riper days not that the summer is less pleasant now than when her mournful hymns did hush the night but that wild music burthens every bough and sweets grown common lose their dear delight therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue because i would not dull you with my song alack what poverty my muse brings forth that having such a scope to show her pride the argument all bare is of more worth than when it hath my added praise beside o blame me not if i no more can write look in your glass and there appears a face that overgoes my blunt invention quite  dulling my lines and doing me disgrace were it not sinful then striving to mend to mar the subject that before was well for to no other pass my verses tend than of your graces and your gifts to tell and more much more than in my verse can sit your own glass shows you when you look in it to me fair friend you never can be old for as you were when first your eye i ey'd such seems your beauty still three winters cold have from the forests shook three summers' pride three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd in process of the seasons have i seen three april perfumes in three hot junes burn'd since first i saw you fresh which yet are green ah yet doth beauty like a dialhand steal from his figure and no pace perceiv'd so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand hath motion and mine eye may be deceiv'd for fear of which hear this thou age unbred ere you were born was beauty's summer dead let not my love be call'd idolatry nor my beloved as an idol show since all alike my songs and praises be to one of one still such and ever so kind is my love today tomorrow kind still constant in a wondrous excellence therefore my verse to constancy confin'd one thing expressing leaves out difference 'fair kind and true' is all my argument 'fair kind and true' varying to other words and in this change is my invention spent three themes in one which wondrous scope affords fair kind and true have often liv'd alone which three till now never kept seat in one when in the chronicle of wasted time i see descriptions of the fairest wights and beauty making beautiful old rime in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow i see their antique pen would have express'd even such a beauty as you master now so all their praises are but prophecies of this our time all you prefiguring and for they looked but with divining eyes they had not skill enough your worth to sing for we which now behold these present days have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul of the wide world dreaming on things to come can yet the lease of my true love control  supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom the mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd and the sad augurs mock their own presage incertainties now crown themselves assur'd and peace proclaims olives of endless age now with the drops of this most balmy time my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes since spite of him i'll live in this poor rime while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes and thou in this shalt find thy monument when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent what's in the brain that ink may character which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit what's new to speak what now to register that may express my love or thy dear merit nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine i must each day say o'er the very same counting no old thing old thou mine i thine  even as when first i hallow'd thy fair name so that eternal love in love's fresh case weighs not the dust and injury of age nor gives to necessary wrinkles place but makes antiquity for aye his page finding the first conceit of love there bred where time and outward form would show it dead o never say that i was false of heart though absence seem'd my flame to qualify as easy might i from my self depart as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie that is my home of love if i have rang'd like him that travels i return again just to the time not with the time exchang'd so that myself bring water for my stain never believe though in my nature reign'd all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood that it could so preposterously be stain'd  to leave for nothing all thy sum of good for nothing this wide universe i call save thou my rose in it thou art my all alas 'tis true i have gone here and there and made my self a motley to the view gor'd mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear made old offences of affections new most true it is that i have look'd on truth askance and strangely but by all above these blenches gave my heart another youth and worse essays prov'd thee my best of love now all is done save what shall have no end mine appetite i never more will grind on newer proof to try an older friend a god in love to whom i am confin'd then give me welcome next my heaven the best even to thy pure and most most loving breast o for my sake do you with fortune chide the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds that did not better for my life provide than public means which public manners breeds thence comes it that my name receives a brand and almost thence my nature is subdu'd to what it works in like the dyer's hand pity me then and wish i were renew'd whilst like a willing patient i will drink potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection no bitterness that i will bitter think nor double penance to correct correction pity me then dear friend and i assure ye even that your pity is enough to cure me your love and pity doth the impression fill which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow for what care i who calls me well or ill  so you o'ergreen my bad my good allow you are my alltheworld and i must strive to know my shames and praises from your tongue none else to me nor i to none alive that my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong in so profound abysm i throw all care of others' voices that my adder's sense to critic and to flatterer stopped are mark how with my neglect i do dispense you are so strongly in my purpose bred that all the world besides methinks are dead since i left you mine eye is in my mind and that which governs me to go about doth part his function and is partly blind seems seeing but effectually is out for it no form delivers to the heart of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch of his quick objects hath the mind no part  nor his own vision holds what it doth catch for if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight the most sweet favour or deformed'st creature the mountain or the sea the day or night the crow or dove it shapes them to your feature incapable of more replete with you my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue or whether doth my mind being crown'd with you drink up the monarch's plague this flattery or whether shall i say mine eye saith true and that your love taught it this alchemy to make of monsters and things indigest such cherubins as your sweet self resemble creating every bad a perfect best as fast as objects to his beams assemble o 'tis the first 'tis flattery in my seeing and my great mind most kingly drinks it up mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing  and to his palate doth prepare the cup if it be poison'd 'tis the lesser sin that mine eye loves it and doth first begin those lines that i before have writ do lie even those that said i could not love you dearer yet then my judgment knew no reason why my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer but reckoning time whose million'd accidents creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp'st intents divert strong minds to the course of altering things alas why fearing of time's tyranny might i not then say 'now i love you best' when i was certain o'er incertainty crowning the present doubting of the rest love is a babe then might i not say so to give full growth to that which still doth grow let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove o no it is an everfixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken it is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown although his height be taken love's not time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle's compass come love alters not with his brief hours and weeks but bears it out even to the edge of doom if this be error and upon me prov'd i never writ nor no man ever lov'd accuse me thus that i have scanted all wherein i should your great deserts repay forgot upon your dearest love to call  whereto all bonds do tie me day by day that i have frequent been with unknown minds and given to time your own dearpurchas'd right that i have hoisted sail to all the winds which should transport me farthest from your sight book both my wilfulness and errors down and on just proof surmise accumulate bring me within the level of your frown but shoot not at me in your waken'd hate since my appeal says i did strive to prove the constancy and virtue of your love like as to make our appetite more keen with eager compounds we our palate urge as to prevent our maladies unseen we sicken to shun sickness when we purge even so being full of your ne'ercloying sweetness to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness to be diseas'd ere that there was true needing thus policy in love to anticipate the ills that were not grew to faults assur'd and brought to medicine a healthful state which rank of goodness would by ill be cur'd but thence i learn and find the lesson true drugs poison him that so fell sick of you what potions have i drunk of siren tears distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears still losing when i saw myself to win what wretched errors hath my heart committed whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted in the distraction of this madding fever o benefit of ill now i find true that better is by evil still made better and ruin'd love when it is built anew grows fairer than at first more strong far greater so i return rebuk'd to my content and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent that you were once unkind befriends me now and for that sorrow which i then did feel needs must i under my transgression bow unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel for if you were by my unkindness shaken as i by yours you've pass'd a hell of time and i a tyrant have no leisure taken to weigh how once i suffer'd in your crime o that our night of woe might have remember'd my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits and soon to you as you to me then tender'd the humble salve which wounded bosoms fits but that your trespass now becomes a fee mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me 'tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd when not to be receives reproach of being and the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd not by our feeling but by others' seeing for why should others' false adulterate eyes give salutation to my sportive blood or on my frailties why are frailer spies which in their wills count bad what i think good no i am that i am and they that level at my abuses reckon up their own i may be straight though they themselves be bevel by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown unless this general evil they maintain all men are bad and in their badness reign thy gift thy tables are within my brain full character'd with lasting memory which shall above that idle rank remain beyond all date even to eternity or at the least so long as brain and heart have faculty by nature to subsist till each to raz'd oblivion yield his part of thee thy record never can be miss'd that poor retention could not so much hold nor need i tallies thy dear love to score therefore to give them from me was i bold to trust those tables that receive thee more to keep an adjunct to remember thee were to import forgetfulness in me no time thou shalt not boast that i do change thy pyramids built up with newer might to me are nothing novel nothing strange they are but dressings of a former sight our dates are brief and therefore we admire what thou dost foist upon us that is old and rather make them born to our desire than think that we before have heard them told thy registers and thee i both defy not wondering at the present nor the past for thy records and what we see doth lie made more or less by thy continual haste this i do vow and this shall ever be i will be true despite thy scythe and thee if my dear love were but the child of state it might for fortune's bastard be unfather'd as subject to time's love or to time's hate weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gather'd no it was builded far from accident it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls under the blow of thralled discontent whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls it fears not policy that heretic which works on leases of shortnumber'd hours but all alone stands hugely politic  that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers to this i witness call the fools of time which die for goodness who have lived for crime were't aught to me i bore the canopy with my extern the outward honouring or laid great bases for eternity which proves more short than waste or ruining have i not seen dwellers on form and favour lose all and more by paying too much rent for compound sweet forgoing simple savour pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent no let me be obsequious in thy heart and take thou my oblation poor but free which is not mix'd with seconds knows no art but mutual render only me for thee hence thou suborned informer a true soul when most impeach'd stands least in thy control o thou my lovely boy who in thy power dost hold time's fickle glass his fickle hour who hast by waning grown and therein show'st thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st if nature sovereign mistress over wrack as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure she may detain but not still keep her treasure her audit though delayed answered must be and her quietus is to render thee in the old age black was not counted fair or if it were it bore not beauty's name but now is black beauty's successive heir and beauty slander'd with a bastard shame for since each hand hath put on nature's power  fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower but is profan'd if not lives in disgrace therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black her eyes so suited and they mourners seem at such who not born fair no beauty lack sland'ring creation with a false esteem yet so they mourn becoming of their woe that every tongue says beauty should look so how oft when thou my music music play'st upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st the wiry concord that mine ear confounds do i envy those jacks that nimble leap to kiss the tender inward of thy hand whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap at the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand to be so tickled they would change their state  and situation with those dancing chips o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait making dead wood more bless'd than living lips since saucy jacks so happy are in this give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss the expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action and till action lust is perjur'd murderous bloody full of blame savage extreme rude cruel not to trust enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight past reason hunted and no sooner had past reason hated as a swallow'd bait on purpose laid to make the taker mad mad in pursuit and in possession so had having and in quest to have extreme a bliss in proof and prov'd a very woe before a joy propos'd behind a dream all this the world well knows yet none knows well to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell my mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun coral is far more red than her lips red if snow be white why then her breasts are dun if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head i have seen roses damask'd red and white but no such roses see i in her cheeks and in some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks i love to hear her speak yet well i know that music hath a far more pleasing sound i grant i never saw a goddess go my mistress when she walks treads on the ground and yet by heaven i think my love as rare as any she belied with false compare thou art as tyrannous so as thou art  as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel for well thou know'st to my dear doting heart thou art the fairest and most precious jewel yet in good faith some say that thee behold thy face hath not the power to make love groan to say they err i dare not be so bold although i swear it to myself alone and to be sure that is not false i swear a thousand groans but thinking on thy face one on another's neck do witness bear thy black is fairest in my judgment's place in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds and thence this slander as i think proceeds thine eyes i love and they as pitying me knowing thy heart torment me with disdain have put on black and loving mourners be looking with pretty ruth upon my pain and truly not the morning sun of heaven  better becomes the grey cheeks of the east nor that full star that ushers in the even doth half that glory to the sober west as those two mourning eyes become thy face o let it then as well beseem thy heart to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace and suit thy pity like in every part then will i swear beauty herself is black and all they foul that thy complexion lack beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan for that deep wound it gives my friend and me is't not enough to torture me alone but slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken and my next self thou harder hast engross'd of him myself and thee i am forsaken a torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward  but then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail whoe'er keeps me let my heart be his guard thou canst not then use rigour in my jail and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee perforce am thine and all that is in me so now i have confess'd that he is thine and i my self am mortgag'd to thy will myself i'll forfeit so that other mine thou wilt restore to be my comfort still but thou wilt not nor he will not be free for thou art covetous and he is kind he learn'd but suretylike to write for me under that bond that him as fast doth bind the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take thou usurer that putt'st forth all to use and sue a friend came debtor for my sake so him i lose through my unkind abuse him have i lost thou hast both him and me he pays the whole and yet am i not free whoever hath her wish thou hast thy 'will' and 'will' to boot and 'will' in overplus more than enough am i that vex'd thee still to thy sweet will making addition thus wilt thou whose will is large and spacious not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine shall will in others seem right gracious and in my will no fair acceptance shine the sea all water yet receives rain still and in abundance addeth to his store so thou being rich in 'will' add to thy 'will' one will of mine to make thy large will more let no unkind 'no' fair beseechers kill think all but one and me in that one 'will' if thy soul check thee that i come so near  swear to thy blind soul that i was thy 'will' and will thy soul knows is admitted there thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil 'will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love ay fill it full with wills and my will one in things of great receipt with ease we prove among a number one is reckon'd none then in the number let me pass untold though in thy store's account i one must be for nothing hold me so it please thee hold that nothing me a something sweet to thee make but my name thy love and love that still and then thou lov'st me for my name is 'will' thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes that they behold and see not what they see they know what beauty is see where it lies yet what the best is take the worst to be if eyes corrupt by overpartial looks  be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks whereto the judgment of my heart is tied why should my heart think that a several plot which my heart knows the wide world's common place or mine eyes seeing this say this is not to put fair truth upon so foul a face in things right true my heart and eyes have err'd and to this false plague are they now transferr'd when my love swears that she is made of truth i do believe her though i know she lies that she might think me some untutor'd youth unlearned in the world's false subtleties thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young although she knows my days are past the best simply i credit her falsespeaking tongue on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed but wherefore says she not she is unjust  and wherefore say not i that i am old o love's best habit is in seeming trust and age in love loves not to have years told therefore i lie with her and she with me and in our faults by lies we flatter'd be o call not me to justify the wrong that thy unkindness lays upon my heart wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue use power with power and slay me not by art tell me thou lov'st elsewhere but in my sight dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside what need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might is more than my o'erpress'd defence can bide let me excuse thee ah my love well knows her pretty looks have been mine enemies and therefore from my face she turns my foes that they elsewhere might dart their injuries yet do not so but since i am near slain  kill me outright with looks and rid my pain be wise as thou art cruel do not press my tonguetied patience with too much disdain lest sorrow lend me words and words express the manner of my pitywanting pain if i might teach thee wit better it were though not to love yet love to tell me so as testy sick men when their deaths be near no news but health from their physicians know for if i should despair i should grow mad and in my madness might speak ill of thee now this illwresting world is grown so bad mad slanderers by mad ears believed be that i may not be so nor thou belied bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes  for they in thee a thousand errors note but 'tis my heart that loves what they despise who in despite of view is pleased to dote nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted nor tender feeling to base touches prone nor taste nor smell desire to be invited to any sensual feast with thee alone but my five wits nor my five senses can dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be only my plague thus far i count my gain that she that makes me sin awards me pain love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving o but with mine compare thou thine own state and thou shalt find it merits not reproving or if it do not from those lips of thine  that have profan'd their scarlet ornaments and seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents be it lawful i love thee as thou lov'st those whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee root pity in thy heart that when it grows thy pity may deserve to pitied be if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide by selfexample mayst thou be denied lo as a careful housewife runs to catch one of her feather'd creatures broke away sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch in pursuit of the thing she would have stay whilst her neglected child holds her in chase cries to catch her whose busy care is bent to follow that which flies before her face not prizing her poor infant's discontent so runn'st thou after that which flies from thee  whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me and play the mother's part kiss me be kind so will i pray that thou mayst have thy 'will' if thou turn back and my loud crying still two loves i have of comfort and despair which like two spirits do suggest me still the better angel is a man right fair the worser spirit a woman colour'd ill to win me soon to hell my female evil tempteth my better angel from my side and would corrupt my saint to be a devil wooing his purity with her foul pride and whether that my angel be turn'd fiend suspect i may yet not directly tell but being both from me both to each friend i guess one angel in another's hell yet this shall i ne'er know but live in doubt  till my bad angel fire my good one out those lips that love's own hand did make breathed forth the sound that said 'i hate' to me that languish'd for her sake but when she saw my woeful state straight in her heart did mercy come chiding that tongue that ever sweet was us'd in giving gentle doom and taught it thus anew to greet 'i hate' she alter'd with an end that followed it as gentle day doth follow night who like a fiend from heaven to hell is flown away 'i hate' from hate away she threw and sav'd my life saying 'not you' poor soul the centre of my sinful earth  my sinful earth these rebel powers array why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth painting thy outward walls so costly gay why so large cost having so short a lease dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend shall worms inheritors of this excess eat up thy charge is this thy body's end then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss and let that pine to aggravate thy store buy terms divine in selling hours of dross within be fed without be rich no more so shall thou feed on death that feeds on men and death once dead there's no more dying then my love is as a fever longing still for that which longer nurseth the disease feeding on that which doth preserve the ill the uncertain sickly appetite to please my reason the physician to my love  angry that his prescriptions are not kept hath left me and i desperate now approve desire is death which physic did except past cure i am now reason is past care and franticmad with evermore unrest my thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are at random from the truth vainly express'd for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright who art as black as hell as dark as night o me what eyes hath love put in my head which have no correspondence with true sight or if they have where is my judgment fled that censures falsely what they see aright if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote what means the world to say it is not so if it be not then love doth well denote love's eye is not so true as all men's no how can it o how can love's eye be true  that is so vexed with watching and with tears no marvel then though i mistake my view the sun itself sees not till heaven clears o cunning love with tears thou keep'st me blind lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find canst thou o cruel say i love thee not when i against myself with thee partake do i not think on thee when i forgot am of my self all tyrant for thy sake who hateth thee that i do call my friend on whom frown'st thou that i do fawn upon nay if thou lour'st on me do i not spend revenge upon myself with present moan what merit do i in my self respect that is so proud thy service to despise when all my best doth worship thy defect commanded by the motion of thine eyes but love hate on for now i know thy mind those that can see thou lov'st and i am blind o from what power hast thou this powerful might with insufficiency my heart to sway to make me give the lie to my true sight and swear that brightness doth not grace the day whence hast thou this becoming of things ill that in the very refuse of thy deeds there is such strength and warrantise of skill that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds who taught thee how to make me love thee more the more i hear and see just cause of hate o though i love what others do abhor with others thou shouldst not abhor my state if thy unworthiness rais'd love in me more worthy i to be belov'd of thee love is too young to know what conscience is  yet who knows not conscience is born of love then gentle cheater urge not my amiss lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove for thou betraying me i do betray my nobler part to my gross body's treason my soul doth tell my body that he may triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason but rising at thy name doth point out thee as his triumphant prize proud of this pride he is contented thy poor drudge to be to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side no want of conscience hold it that i call her 'love' for whose dear love i rise and fall in loving thee thou know'st i am forsworn but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing in act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn in vowing new hate after new love bearing but why of two oaths' breach do i accuse thee  when i break twenty i am perjur'd most for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee and all my honest faith in thee is lost for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness or made them swear against the thing they see for i have sworn thee fair more perjur'd i to swear against the truth so foul a lie cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep a maid of dian's this advantage found and his lovekindling fire did quickly steep in a cold valleyfountain of that ground which borrow'd from this holy fire of love a dateless lively heat still to endure and grew a seeting bath which yet men prove against strange maladies a sovereign cure but at my mistress' eye love's brand newfired  the boy for trial needs would touch my breast i sick withal the help of bath desired and thither hied a sad distemper'd guest but found no cure the bath for my help lies where cupid got new fire my mistress' eyes the little lovegod lying once asleep laid by his side his heartinflaming brand whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep came tripping by but in her maiden hand the fairest votary took up that fire which many legions of true hearts had warm'd and so the general of hot desire was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd this brand she quenched in a cool well by which from love's fire took heat perpetual growing a bath and healthful remedy for men diseas'd but i my mistress' thrall came there for cure and this by that i prove  love's fire heats water water cools not love ye who in rhymes dispersed the echoes hear of those sad sighs with which my heart i fed when early youth my mazy wanderings led fondly diverse from what i now appear fluttering 'twixt frantic hope and frantic fear from those by whom my various style is read i hope if e'er their hearts for love have bled not only pardon but perhaps a tear but now i clearly see that of mankind long time i was the tale whence bitter thought and selfreproach with frequent blushes teem while of my frenzy shame the fruit i find and sad repentance and the proof dearbought that the world's joy is but a flitting dream o ye who list in scatter'd verse the sound of all those sighs with which my heart i fed when i by youthful error first misled unlike my present self in heart was found who list the plaints the reasonings that abound throughout my song by hopes and vain griefs bred if e'er true love its influence o'er ye shed oh let your pity be with pardon crown'd but now full well i see how to the crowd for length of time i proved a public jest e'en by myself my folly is allow'd and of my vanity the fruit is shame repentance and a knowledge strong imprest that worldly pleasure is a passing dream ye who may listen to each idle strain bearing those sighs on which my heart was fed in life's first morn by youthful error led far other then from what i now remain that thus in varying numbers i complain numbers of sorrow vain and vain hope bred if any in love's lore be practisèd his pardone'en his pity i may obtain but now aware that to mankind my name too long has been a byeword and a scorn i blush before my own severer thought of my past wanderings the sole fruit is shame and deep repentance of the knowledge born that all we value in this world is naught for many a crime at once to make me smart and a delicious vengeance to obtain love secretly took up his bow again as one who acts the cunning coward's part my courage had retired within my heart there to defend the pass bright eyes might gain when his dread archery was pour'd amain where blunted erst had fallen every dart scared at the sudden brisk attack i found nor time nor vigour to repel the foe with weapons suited to the direful need no kind protection of rough rising ground where from defeat i might securely speed which fain i would e'en now but ah no method know one sweet and signal vengeance to obtain to punish in a day my life's long crime as one who bent on harm waits place and time love craftily took up his bow again my virtue had retired to watch my heart thence of weak eyes the danger to repell when momently a mortal blow there fell where blunted hitherto dropt every dart and thus o'erpower'd in that first attack she had nor vigour left enough nor room even to arm her for my pressing need nor to the steep and painful mountain back to draw me safe and scathless from that doom whence though alas too weak she fain had freed 'twas on the morn when heaven its blessed ray in pity to its suffering master veil'd first did i lady to your beauty yield of your victorious eyes th' unguarded prey ah little reck'd i that on such a day needed against love's arrows any shield and trod securely trod the fatal field whence with the world's began my heart's dismay on every side love found his victim bare and through mine eyes transfix'd my throbbing heart those eyes which now with constant sorrows flow but poor the triumph of his boasted art who thus could pierce a naked youth nor dare to you in armour mail'd even to display his bow 'twas on the blessed morning when the sun in pity to our maker hid his light that unawares the captive i was won lady of your bright eyes which chain'd me quite that seem'd to me no time against the blows of love to make defence to frame relief secure and unsuspecting thus my woes date their commencement from the common grief love found me feeble then and fenceless all open the way and easy to my heart through eyes where since my sorrows ebb and flow but therein was methinks his triumph small on me in that weak state to strike his dart yet hide from you so strong his very bow he that with wisdom goodness power divine did ample nature's perfect book design adorn'd this beauteous world and those above kindled fierce mars and soften'd milder jove when seen on earth the shadows to fulfill of the less volume which conceal'd his will took john and peter from their homely care and made them pillars of his temple fair nor in imperial rome would he be born whom servile judah yet received with scorn e'en bethlehem could her infant king disown and the rude manger was his early throne victorious sufferings did his pomp display nor other chariot or triumphal way at once by heaven's example and decree such honour waits on such humility the high eternal in whose works supreme the master's vast creative power hath spoke at whose command each circling sphere awoke jove mildly rose and mars with fiercer beam to earth he came to ratify the scheme reveal'd to us through prophecy's dark cloak to sound redemption speak man's fallen yoke he chose the humblest for that heavenly theme but he conferr'd not on imperial rome his birth's renown he chose a lowlier sky to stand through him the proudest spot on earth and now doth shine within its humble home a star that doth each other so outvie that grateful nature hails its lovely birth who show'd such infinite providence and skill in his eternal government divine who launch'd the spheres gave sun and moon to shine and brightest wonders the dark void to fill on earth who came the scriptures to maintain which for long years the truth had buried yet took john and peter from the fisher's net and gave to each his part in the heavenly reign he for his birth fair rome preferr'd not then but lowly bethlehem thus o'er proudest state he ever loves humility to raise now rises from small spot like sun again whom nature hails the place grows bright and great which birth so heavenly to our earth displays in sighs when i outbreathe your cherish'd name that name which love has writ upon my heart laud instantly upon my doting tongue at the first thought of its sweet sound is heard your regal state which i encounter next doubles my valour in that high emprize but tacit ends the word your praise to tell is fitting load for better backs than mine thus all who call you by the name itself are taught at once to laud and to revere o worthy of all reverence and esteem save that perchance apollo may disdain that mortal tongue of his immortal boughs should ever so presume as e'en to speak so wayward now my will and so unwise to follow her who turns from me in flight and from love's fetters free herself and light before my slow and shackled motion flies that less it lists the more my sighs and cries would point where passes the safe path and right nor aught avails to check or to excite for love's own nature curb and spur defies thus when perforce the bridle he has won and helpless at his mercy i remain against my will he speeds me to mine end 'neath yon cold laurel whose false boughs upon hangs the harsh fruit which tasted spreads the pain i sought to stay and mars where it should mend my tameless will doth recklessly pursue her who unshackled by love's heavy chain flies swiftly from its chase whilst i in vain my fetter'd journey pantingly renew the safer track i offer to its view but hopeless is my power to restrain it rides regardless of the spur or rein love makes it scorn the hand that would subdue the triumph won the bridle all its own without one curb i stand within its power and my destruction helplessly presage it guides me to that laurel ever known to all who seek the healing of its flower to aggravate the wound it should assuage torn is each virtue from its earthly throne by sloth intemperance and voluptuous ease e'en nature deviates from her wonted ways too much the slave of vicious custom grown far hence is every light celestial gone that guides mankind through life's perplexing maze and those whom helicon's sweet waters please from mocking crowds receive contempt alone who now would laurel myrtlewreaths obtain let want let shame philosophy attend cries the base world intent on sordid gain what though thy favourite path be trod by few let it but urge thee more dear gentle friend thy great design of glory to pursue intemperance slumber and the slothful down have chased each virtue from this world away hence is our nature nearly led astray from its due course by habitude o'erthrown those kindly lights of heaven so dim are grown which shed o'er human life instruction's ray that him with scornful wonder they survey who would draw forth the stream of helicon whom doth the laurel please or myrtle now naked and poor philosophy art thou the worthless crowd intent on lucre cries few on thy chosen road will thee attend yet let it more incite thee gentle friend to prosecute thy highconceived emprize beneath the verdant hillswhere the fair vest of earthly mould first took the lady dear who him that sends us feather'd captives here awakens often from his tearful rest lived we in freedom and in quiet blest with everything which life below might cheer no foe suspecting harass'd by no fear that aught our wanderings ever could molest but snatch'd from that serener life and thrown to the low wretched state we here endure one comfort short of death survives alone vengeance upon our captor full and sure who slave himself at others' power remains pent in worse prison bound by sterner chains beneath those very hills where beauty threw her mantle first o'er that earthmoulded fair who oft from sleep while shedding many a tear awakens him that sends us unto you our lives in peacefulness and freedom flew e'en as all creatures wish who hold life dear nor deem'd we aught could in its course come near whence to our wanderings danger might accrue but from the wretched state to which we're brought leaving another with sereneness fraught nay e'en from death one comfort we obtain that vengeance follows him who sent us here another's utmost thraldom doomed to bear bound he now lies with a still stronger chain when the great planet which directs the hours to dwell with taurus from the north is borne such virtue rays from each enkindled horn rare beauty instantly all nature dowers nor this alone which meets our sight that flowers richly the upland and the vale adorn but earth's cold womb else lustreless and lorn is quick and warm with vivifying powers till herbs and fruits like these i send are rife so she a sun amid her fellow fair shedding the rays of her bright eyes on me thoughts acts and words of love wakes into life but ah for me is no new spring nor e'er smile they on whom she will again can be when taurus in his house doth phoebus keep there pours so bright a virtue from his crest that nature wakes and stands in beauty drest the flow'ring meadows start with joy from sleep nor they alone rejoiceearth's bosom deep though not one beam illumes her night of rest responsive smiles and from her fruitful breast gives forth her treasures for her sons to reap thus she who dwells amid her sex a sun shedding upon my soul her eyes' full light each thought creates each deed each word of love but though my heart's proud mastery she hath won alas within me dwells eternal night my spirit ne'er spring's genial breath doth prove glorious colonna still the strength and stay of our best hopes and the great latin name whom power could never from the true right way seduce by flattery or by terror tame no palace theatres nor arches here but in their stead the fir the beech and pine on the green sward with the fair mountain near paced to and fro by poet friend of thine thus unto heaven the soul from earth is caught while philomel who sweetly to the shade the livelong night her desolate lot complains fills the soft heart with many an amorous thought ah why is so rare good imperfect made while severed from us still my lord remains glorious colonna thou the latins' hope the proud supporter of our lofty name thou hold'st thy path of virtue still the same amid the thunderings of rome's jovethe pope not here do human structures interlope the fir to rival or the pinetree's claim the soul may revel in poetic flame upon yon mountain's green and gentle slope and thus from earth to heaven the spirit soars whilst philomel her tale of woe repeats amid the sympathising shades of night thus through man's breast love's current sweetly pours yet still thine absence half the joy defeats alas my friend why dim such radiant light never thy veil in sun or in the shade lady a moment i have seen quitted since of my heart the queen mine eyes confessing thee my heart betray'd while my enamour'd thoughts i kept conceal'd those fond vain hopes by which i die in thy sweet features kindness beam'd changed was the gentle language of thine eye soon as my foolish heart itself reveal'd and all that mildness which i changeless deem'd all all withdrawn which most my soul esteem'd yet still the veil i must obey which whatsoe'er the aspect of the day thine eyes' fair radiance hides my life to overshade wherefore my unkind fair one say whether the sun fierce darts his ray or whether gloom o'erspreads the sky that envious veil is ne'er thrown by though well you read my heart and knew how much i long'd your charms to view while i conceal'd each tender thought that my fond mind's destruction wrought your face with pity sweetly shone but when love made my passion known your sunny locks were seen no more nor smiled your eyes as heretofore behind a jealous cloud retired those beauties which i most admired and shall a veil thus rule my fate o cruel veil that whether heat or cold be felt art doom'd to prove fatal to me shadowing the lights i love if o'er each bitter pang each hidden throe sadly triumphant i my years drag on till even the radiance of those eyes is gone lady which starlike now illume thy brow and silver'd are those locks of golden glow and wreaths and robes of green aside are thrown and from thy cheek those hues of beauty flown which check'd so long the utterance of my woe haply my bolder tongue may then reveal the bosom'd annals of my heart's fierce fire the martyrthrobs that now in night i veil and should the chill time frown on young desire still still some late remorse that breast may feel and heave a tardy sighere love with life expire lady if grace to me so long be lent from love's sharp tyranny and trials keen ere my last days in life's far vale are seen to know of thy bright eyes the lustre spent the fine gold of thy hair with silver sprent neglected the gay wreaths and robes of green pale too and thin the face which made me e'en 'gainst injury slow and timid to lament then will i for such boldness love would give lay bare my secret heart in martyr's fire years days and hours that yet has known to live and though the time then suit not fair desire at least there may arrive to my long grief too late of tender sighs the poor relief throned on her angel brow when love displays his radiant form among all other fair far as eclipsed their choicest charms appear i feel beyond its wont my passion blaze and still i bless the day the hour the place when first so high mine eyes i dared to rear and say fond heart thy gratitude declare that then thou had'st the privilege to gaze 'twas she inspired the tender thought of love which points to heaven and teaches to despise the earthly vanities that others prize she gave the soul's light grace which to the skies bids thee straight onward in the right path move whence buoy'd by hope e'en now i soar to worlds above when love whose proper throne is that sweet face at times escorts her 'mid the sisters fair as their each beauty is than hers less rare so swells in me the fond desire apace i bless the hour the season and the place so high and heavenward when my eyes could dare and say my heart in grateful memory bear this lofty honour and surpassing grace from her descends the tender truthful thought which follow'd bliss supreme shall thee repay who spurn'st the vanities that win the crowd from her that gentle graceful love is caught to heaven which leads thee by the righthand way and crowns e'en here with hopes both pure and proud my wearied eyes while looking thus on that fair fatal face to us be wise be brief forhence my sighs already love our bliss denies death only can the amorous track shut from my thoughts which leads them back to the sweet port of all their weal but lesser objects may conceal our light from you that meaner far in virtue and perfection are wherefore poor eyes ere yet appears already nigh the time of tears now after long privation past look and some comfort take at last with weary frame which painfully i bear i look behind me at each onward pace and then take comfort from your native air which following fans my melancholy face the far way my frail life the cherish'd fair whom thus i leave as then my thoughts retrace i fix my feet in silent pale despair and on the earth my tearful eyes abase at times a doubt too rises on my woes how ever can this weak and wasted frame live from life's spirit and one source afar love's answer soon the truth forgotten shows this high pure privilege true lovers claim who from mere human feelings franchised are i look behind each step i onward trace scarce able to support my wearied frame ah wretched me i pantingly exclaim and from her atmosphere new strength embrace i think on her i leavemy heart's best grace my lengthen'd journeylife's capricious flame i pause in withering fear with purpose tame whilst down my cheek tears quick each other chase my doubting heart thus questions in my grief whence comes it that existence thou canst know when from thy spirit thou dost dwell entire love holy love my heart then answers brief such privilege i do on all bestow who feed my flame with nought of earthly fire the palmer bent with locks of silver gray quits the sweet spot where he has pass'd his years quits his poor family whose anxious fears paint the loved father fainting on his way and trembling on his aged limbs slow borne in these last days that close his earthly course he in his soul's strong purpose finds new force though weak with age though by long travel worn thus reaching rome led on by pious love he seeks the image of that saviour lord whom soon he hopes to meet in bliss above so oft in other forms i seek to trace some charm that to my heart may yet afford a faint resemblance of thy matchless grace as parts the aged pilgrim worn and gray from the dear spot his life where he had spent from his poor family by sorrow rent whose love still fears him fainting in decay thence dragging heavily in life's last day his suffering frame on pious journey bent pricking with earnest prayers his good intent though bow'd with years and weary with the way he reaches rome still following his desire the likeness of his lord on earth to see whom yet he hopes in heaven above to meet so i too seek nor in the fond quest tire lady in other fair if aught there be that faintly may recall thy beauties sweet down my cheeks bitter tears incessant rain and my heart struggles with convulsive sighs when laura upon you i turn my eyes for whom the world's allurements i disdain but when i see that gentle smile again that modest sweet and tender smile arise it pours on every sense a blest surprise lost in delight is all my torturing pain too soon this heavenly transport sinks and dies when all thy soothing charms my fate removes at thy departure from my ravish'd view to that sole refuge its firm faith approves my spirit from my ravish'd bosom flies and wing'd with fond remembrance follows you tears bitter tears adown my pale cheek rain bursts from mine anguish'd breast a storm of sighs whene'er on you i turn my passionate eyes for whom alone this bright world i disdain true to my ardent wishes and old pain that mild sweet smile a peaceful balm supplies rescues me from the martyr fire that tries rapt and intent on you whilst i remain thus in your presencebut my spirits freeze when ushering with fond acts a warm adieu my fatal stars from life's quench'd heaven decay my soul released at last with love's apt keys but issues from my heart to follow you nor tears itself without much thought away when i reflect and turn me to that part whence my sweet lady beam'd in purest light and in my inmost thought remains that light which burns me and consumes in every part i who yet dread lest from my heart it part and see at hand the end of this my light go lonely like a man deprived of light ignorant where to go whence to depart thus flee i from the stroke which lays me dead yet flee not with such speed but that desire follows companion of my flight alone silent i gobut these my words though dead others would cause to weepthis i desire that i may weep and waste myself alone when all my mind i turn to the one part where sheds my lady's face its beauteous light and lingers in my loving thought the light that burns and racks within me ev'ry part i from my heart who fear that it may part and see the near end of my single light go as a blind man groping without light who knows not where yet presses to depart thus from the blows which ever wish me dead i flee but not so swiftly that desire ceases to come as is its wont with me silent i move for accents of the dead would melt the general age and i desire that sighs and tears should only fall from me creatures there are in life of such keen sight that no defence they need from noonday sun and others dazzled by excess of light who issue not abroad till day is done and with weak fondness some because 'tis bright who in the deathflame for enjoyment run thus proving theirs a different virtue quite alas of this last kind myself am one for of this fair the splendour to regard i am but weak and illagainst late hours and darkness gath'ring roundmyself to ward wherefore with tearful eyes of failing powers my destiny condemns me still to turn where following faster i but fiercer burn ashamed sometimes thy beauties should remain as yet unsung sweet lady in my rhyme when first i saw thee i recall the time pleasing as none shall ever please again but no fit polish can my verse attain not mine is strength to try the task sublime my genius measuring its power to climb from such attempt doth prudently refrain full oft i oped my lips to chant thy name then in mid utterance the lay was lost but say what muse can dare so bold a flight full oft i strove in measure to indite but ah the pen the hand the vein i boast at once were vanquish'd by the mighty theme ashamed at times that i am silent yet lady though your rare beauties prompt my rhyme when first i saw thee i recall the time such as again no other can be met but with such burthen on my shoulders set my mind its frailty feeling cannot climb and shrinks alike from polish'd and sublime while my vain utterance frozen terrors let often already have i sought to sing but midway in my breast the voice was stay'd for ah so high what praise may ever spring and oft have i the tender verse essay'd but still in vain pen hand and intellect in the first effort conquer'd are and check'd a thousand times sweet warrior have i tried proffering my heart to thee some peace to gain from those bright eyes but still alas in vain to such low level stoops not thy chaste pride if others seek the love thus thrown aside vain were their hopes and labours to obtain the heart thou spurnest i alike disdain to thee displeasing 'tis by me denied but if discarded thus it find not thee its joyless exile willing to befriend alone untaught at others' will to wend soon from life's weary burden will it flee how heavy then the guilt to both but more to thee for thee it did the most adore a thousand times sweet warrior to obtain peace with those beauteous eyes i've vainly tried proffering my heart but with that lofty pride to bend your looks so lowly you refrain expects a stranger fair that heart to gain in frail fallacious hopes will she confide it never more to me can be allied since what you scorn dear lady i disdain in its sad exile if no aid you lend banish'd by me and it can neither stay alone nor yet another's call obey its vital course must hasten to its end ah me how guilty then we both should prove but guilty you the most for you it most doth love to every animal that dwells on earth except to those which have in hate the sun their time of labour is while lasts the day but when high heaven relumes its thousand stars this seeks his hut and that its native wood each finds repose at least until the dawn but i when fresh and fair begins the dawn to chase the lingering shades that cloak'd the earth wakening the animals in every wood no truce to sorrow find while rolls the sun and when again i see the glistening stars still wander weeping wishing for the day when sober evening chases the bright day and this our darkness makes for others dawn pensive i look upon the cruel stars which framed me of such pliant passionate earth and curse the day that e'er i saw the sun which makes me native seem of wildest wood and yet methinks was ne'er in any wood so wild a denizen by night or day as she whom thus i blame in shade and sun me night's first sleep o'ercomes not nor the dawn for though in mortal coil i tread the earth my firm and fond desire is from the stars ere up to you i turn o lustrous stars or downwards in love's labyrinthine wood leaving my fleshly frame in mouldering earth could i but pity find in her one day would many years redeem and to the dawn with bliss enrich me from the setting sun oh might i be with her where sinks the sun no other eyes upon us but the stars alone one sweet night ended by no dawn nor she again transfigured in green wood to cheat my clasping arms as on the day when phoebus vainly follow'd her on earth i shall lie low in earth in crumbling wood and clustering stars shall gem the noon of day ere on so sweet a dawn shall rise that sun each creature on whose wakeful eyes the bright sun pours his golden fire by day a destined toil pursues and when heaven's lamps illume the skies all to some haunt for rest retire till a fresh dawn that toil renews but i when a new morn doth rise chasing from earth its murky shades while ring the forests with delight find no remission of my sighs and soon as night her mantle spreads i weep and wish returning light again when eve bids day retreat o'er other climes to dart its rays pensive those cruel stars i view which influence thus my amorous fate and imprecate that beauty's blaze which o'er my form such wildness threw no forest surely in its glooms nurtures a savage so unkind as she who bids these sorrows flow me nor the dawn nor sleep o'ercomes for though of mortal mould my mind feels more than passion's mortal glow ere up to you bright orbs i fly or to love's bower speed down my way while here my mouldering limbs remain let me her pity once espy thus rich in bliss one little day shall recompense whole years of pain be laura mine at set of sun let heaven's fires only mark our loves and the day ne'er its light renew my fond embrace may she not shun nor phoebuslike through laurel groves may i a nymph transform'd pursue but i shall cast this mortal veil on earth and stars shall gild the noon ere such bright scenes have birth in the sweet season when my life was new which saw the birth and still the being sees of the fierce passion for my ill that grew fain would i singmy sorrow to appease how then i lived in liberty at ease while o'er my heart held slighted love no sway and how at length by too high scorn for aye i sank his slave and what befell me then whereby to all a warning i remain although my sharpest pain be elsewhere written so that many a pen is tired already and in every vale the echo of my heavy sighs is rife some credence forcing of my anguish'd life and as her wont if here my memory fail be my long martyrdom its saving plea and the one thought which so its torment made as every feeling else to throw in shade and make me of myself forgetful be ruling life's inmost core its bare rind left for me long years and many had pass'd o'er my head since in love's first assault was dealt my wound and from my brow its youthful air had fled while cold and cautious thoughts my heart around had made it almost adamantine ground to loosen which hard passion gave no rest no sorrow yet with tears had bathed my breast nor broke my sleep and what was not in mine a miracle to me in others seem'd life's sure test death is deem'd as cloudless eve best proves the past day fine ah me the tyrant whom i sing descried ere long his error that till then his dart not yet beneath the gown had pierced my heart and brought a puissant lady as his guide 'gainst whom of small or no avail has been genius or force to strive or supplicate these two transform'd me to my present state making of breathing man a laurel green which loses not its leaves though wintry blasts be keen what my amaze when first i fully learn'd the wondrous change upon my person done and saw my thin hairs to those green leaves turn'd whence yet for them a crown i might have won my feet wherewith i stood and moved and run thus to the soul the subject members bow become two roots upon the shore not now of fabled peneus but a stream as proud and stiffen'd to a branch my either arm nor less was my alarm when next my frame white down was seen to shroud while 'neath the deadly leven shatter'd lay my first green hope that soar'd too proud in air because in sooth i knew not when nor where i left my latter state but night and day where it was struck alone in tears i went still seeking it alwhere and in the wave and for its fatal fall while able gave my tongue no respite from its one lament for the sad snowy swan both form and language lent thus that loved wavemy mortal speech put by for birdlike songi track'd with constant feet still asking mercy with a stranger cry but ne'er in tones so tender nor so sweet knew i my amorous sorrow to repeat as might her hard and cruel bosom melt judge still if memory sting what then i felt but ah not now the past it rather needs of her my lovely and inveterate foe the present power to show though such she be all language as exceeds she with a glance who rules us as her own opening my breast my heart in hand to take thus said to me of this no mention make i saw her then in alter'd air alone so that i recognised her noto shame be on my truant mind and faithless sight and when the truth i told her in sore fright she soon resumed her old accustom'd frame while desperate and half dead a hard rock mine became as spoke she o'er her mien such feeling stirr'd that from the solid rock with lively fear haply i am not what you deem i heard and then methought if she but help me here no life can ever weary be or drear to make me weep return my banish'd lord i know not how but thence the power restored blaming no other than myself i went and nor alive nor dead the long day past but because time flies fast and the pen answers ill my good intent full many a thing long written in my mind i here omit and only mention such whereat who hears them now will marvel much death so his hand around my vitals twined not silence from its grasp my heart could save or succour to its outraged virtue bring as speech to me was a forbidden thing to paper and to ink my griefs i gave life not my own is lost through you who dig my grave i fondly thought before her eyes at length though low and lost some mercy to obtain and this the hope which lent my spirit strength sometimes humility o'ercomes disdain sometimes inflames it to worse spite again this knew i who so long was left in night that from such prayers had disappear'd my light till i who sought her still nor found alas even her shade nor of her feet a sign outwearied and supine as one who midway sleeps upon the grass threw me and there accusing the brief ray of bitter tears i loosed the prison'd flood to flow and fall to them as seem'd it good ne'er vanish'd snow before the sun away as then to melt apace it me befell till 'neath a spreading beech a fountain swell'd long in that change my humid course i held who ever saw from man a true fount well and yet though strange it sound things known and sure i tell the soul from god its nobler nature gains for none save he such favour could bestow and like our maker its high state retains to pardon who is never tired nor slow if but with humble heart and suppliant show for mercy for past sins to him we bend and if against his wont he seem to lend awhile a cold ear to our earnest prayers 'tis that right fear the sinner more may fill for he repents but ill his old crime for another who prepares thus when my lady while her bosom yearn'd with pity deign'd to look on me and knew that equal with my fault its penance grew to my old state and shape i soon return'd but nought there is on earth in which the wise may trust for wearying braving her afresh to rugged stone she changed my quivering flesh so that in their old strain my broken cries in vain ask'd death or told her one name to deaf skies a sad and wandering shade i next recall through many a distant and deserted glen that long i mourn'd my indissoluble thrall at length my malady seem'd ended when i to my earthly frame return'd again haply but greater grief therein to feel still following my desire with such fond zeal that once beneath the proud sun's fiercest blaze returning from the chase as was my wont naked where gush'd a font my fair and fatal tyrant met my gaze i whom nought else could pleasure paused to look while touch'd with shame as natural as intense herself to hide or punish my offence she o'er my face the crystal waters shook i still speak true though truth may seem a lie instantly from my proper person torn a solitary stag i felt me borne in wingèd terrors the dark forest through as still of my own dogs the rushing storm i flew my song i never was that cloud of gold which once descended in such precious rain easing awhile with bliss jove's amorous pain i was a flame kindled by one bright eye i was the bird which gladly soar'd on high exalting her whose praise in song i wake nor for new fancies knew i to forsake my first fond laurel 'neath whose welcome shade ever from my firm heart all meaner pleasures fade if the worldhonour'd leaf whose green defies the wrath of heaven when thunders mighty jove had not to me prohibited the crown which wreathes of wont the gifted poet's brow i were a friend of these your idols too whom our vile age so shamelessly ignores but that sore insult keeps me now aloof from the first patron of the olive bough for ethiop earth beneath its tropic sun ne'er burn'd with such fierce heat as i with rage at losing thing so comely and beloved resort then to some calmer fuller fount for of all moisture mine is drain'd and dry save that which falleth from mine eyes in tears love grieved and i with him at times to see by what strange practices and cunning art you still continued from his fetters free from whom my feet were never far apart since to the right way brought by god's decree lifting my hands to heaven with pious heart i thank him for his love and grace for he the soulprayer of the just will never thwart and if returning to the amorous strife its fair desire to teach us to deny hollows and hillocks in thy path abound 'tis but to prove to us with thorns how rife the narrow way the ascent how hard and high where with true virtue man at last is crown'd than me more joyful never reach'd the shore a vessel by the winds long tost and tried whose crew late hopeless on the waters wide to a good god their thanks now prostrate pour nor captive from his dungeon ever tore around whose neck the noose of death was tied more glad than me that weapon laid aside which to my lord hostility long bore all ye who honour love in poet strain to the good minstrel of the amorous lay return due praise though once he went astray for greater glory is in heaven's blest reign over one sinner saved and higher praise than e'en for ninetynine of perfect ways the high successor of our charles[p] whose hair the crown of his great ancestor adorns already has ta'en arms to bruise the horns of babylon and all her name who bear christ's holy vicar with the honour'd load of keys and cloak returning to his home shall see bologna and our noble rome if no ill fortune bar his further road best to your meek and highborn lamb belongs to beat the fierce wolf down so may it be with all who loyalty and love deny console at length your waiting country's wrongs and rome's who longs once more her spouse to see and gird for christ the good sword on thy thigh [footnote p charlemagne] o spirit wish'd and waited for in heaven that wearest gracefully our human clay not as with loading sin and earthly stain who lov'st our lord's high bidding to obey henceforth to thee the way is plain and even by which from hence to bliss we may attain to waft o'er yonder main thy bark that bids the world adieu for aye to seek a better strand the western winds their ready wings expand which through the dangers of that dusky way where all deplore the first infringed command will guide her safe from primal bondage free reckless to stop or stay to that true east where she desires to be haply the faithful vows and zealous prayers and pious tears by holy mortals shed have come before the mercyseat above yet vows of ours but little can bestead nor human orison such merit bears as heavenly justice from its course can move but he the king whom angels serve and love his gracious eyes hath turn'd upon the land where on the cross he died and a new charlemagne hath qualified to work the vengeance that on high was plann'd for whose delay so long hath europe sigh'd such mighty aid he brings his faithful spouse that at its sound the pride of babylon with trembling terror bows all dwellers 'twixt the hills and wild garonne the rhodanus and rhine and briny wave are banded under redcross banners brave and all who honour'd guerdon fain would have from pyrenees to the utmost west are gone leaving iberia lorn of warriors keen and britain with the

zeal rush on what cause what love to this compared may be what spouse or infant train e'er kindled such a righteous enmity there is a portion of the world that lies far distant from the sun's allcheering ray for ever wrapt in ice and gelid snows there under cloudy skies in stinted day a people dwell whose heart their clime outvies by nature framed stern foemen of repose now new devotion in their bosom glows with gothic fury now they grasp the sword turk arab and chaldee with all between us and that sanguine sea who trust in idolgods and slight the lord thou know'st how soon their feeble strength would yield a naked race fearful and indolent unused the brand to wield whose distant aim upon the wind is sent now is the time to shake the ancient yoke from off our necks and rend the veil aside that long in darkness hath involved our eyes let all whom heaven with genius hath supplied and all who great apollo's name invoke with fiery eloquence point out the prize with tongue and pen

my eyes o song nor seas streams heights so long have barr'd and bann'd but love alone who with his haughty lights the more allures me as he worse excites till nature fails against his constant wiles go then and join thy comrades not alone beneath fair female zone dwells love who at his will moves us to tears or smiles green robes and red purple or brown or gray no lady ever wore nor hair of gold in sunny tresses twined so beautiful as she who spoils my mind of judgment and from freedom's lofty path so draws me with her that i may not bear any less heavy yoke and if indeed at timesfor wisdom fails where martyrdom breeds doubt the soul should ever arm it to complain suddenly from each reinless rude desire her smile recalls and razes from my heart every rash enterprise while all disdain is soften'd in her sight for all that i have ever borne for love and still am doom'd to bear till she who wounded it shall heal my heart rejecting homage e'en while she invites be vengeance done but let not pride nor ire 'gainst my humility the lovely pass by which i enter'd bar the hour and day wherein i oped my eyes on the bright black and white which drive me thence where eager love impell'd where of that life which now my sorrow makes new roots and she in whom our age is proud whom to behold without a tender awe needs heart of lead or wood the tear then from these eyes that frequent falls he thus my pale cheek bathes who planted first within my fenceless flank love's shaftdiverts me not from my desire and in just part the proper sentence falls for her my spirit sighs and worthy she to staunch its secret wounds spring from within me these conflicting thoughts to weary wound myself each a sure sword against its master turn'd nor do i pray her to be therefore freed for less direct to heaven all other paths and to that glorious kingdom none can soar certes in sounder bark benignant stars their bright companionship gave to the fortunate side when came that fair birth on our nether world its sole star since who as the laurel leaf the worth of honour fresh and fragrant keeps where lightnings play not nor ungrateful winds ever o'ersway its head well know i that the hope to paint in verse her praises would but tire the worthiest hand that e'er put forth its pen who in all memory's richest cells e'er saw such angel virtue so rare beauty shrined as in those eyes twin symbols of all worth sweet keys of my gone heart lady wherever shines the sun than you love has no dearer pledge a youthful lady 'neath a laurel green was seated fairer colder than the snow on which no sun has shone for many years her sweet speech her bright face and flowing hair so pleased she yet is present to my eyes and aye must be whatever fate prevail these my fond thoughts of her shall fade and fail when foliage ceases on the laurel green nor calm can be my heart nor check'd these eyes until the fire shall freeze or burns the snow easier upon my head to count each hair than ere that day shall dawn the parting years but since time flies and roll the rapid years and death may in the midst of life assail with full brown locks or scant and silver hair i still the shade of that sweet laurel green follow through fiercest sun and deepest snow till the last day shall close my weary eyes oh never sure were seen such brilliant eyes in this our age or in the older years which mould and melt me as the sun melts snow into a stream of tears adown the vale watering the hard roots of that laurel green whose boughs are diamonds and gold whose hair i fear that time my mien may change and hair ere with true pity touch'd shall greet my eyes my idol imaged in that laurel green for unless memory err through seven long years till now full many a shore has heard my wail by night at noon in summer and in snow thus fire within without the cold cold snow alone with these my thoughts and her bright hair alway and everywhere i bear my ail haply to find some mercy in the eyes of unborn nations and far future years if so long flourishes our laurel green the gold and topaz of the sun on snow are shamed by the bright hair above those eyes searing the short green of my life's vain years that graceful soul in mercy call'd away before her time to bid the world farewell if welcomed as she ought in the realms of day in heaven's most blessèd regions sure shall dwell there between mars and venus if she stay her sight the brightness of the sun will quell because her infinite beauty to survey the spirits of the blest will round her swell if she decide upon the fourth fair nest each of the three to dwindle will begin and she alone the fame of beauty win nor e'en in the fifth circle may she rest thence higher if she soar i surely trust jove with all other stars in darkness will be thrust near and more near as life's last period draws which oft is hurried on by human woe i see the passing hours more swiftly flow and all my hopes in disappointment close and to my heart i say amidst its throes not long shall we discourse of love below for this my earthly load like newfall'n snow fast melting soon shall leave us to repose with it will sink in dust each towering hope cherish'd so long within my faithful breast no more shall we resent fear smile complain then shall we clearly trace why some are blest through deepest misery raised to fortune's top and why so many sighs so oft are heaved in vain the nearer i approach my life's last day the certain day that limits human woe i better mark in time's swift silent flow how the fond hopes he brought all pass'd away of love no longerto myself i say we now may commune for as virgin snow the hard and heavy load we drag below dissolves and dies ere rest in heaven repay and prostrate with it must each fair hope lie which here beguiled us and betray'd so long and joy grief fear and pride alike shall cease and then too shall we see with clearer eye how oft we trod in weary ways and wrong and why so long in vain we sigh'd for peace throughout the orient now began to flame the star of love while o'er the northern sky that which has oft raised juno's jealousy pour'd forth its beauteous scintillating beam beside her kindled hearth the housewife dame halfdress'd and slipshod 'gan her distaff ply and now the wonted hour of woe drew nigh that wakes to tears the lover from his dream when my sweet hope unto my mind appear'd not in the custom'd way unto my sight for grief had bathed my lids and sleep had weigh'd ah me how changed that form by love endear'd why lose thy fortitude methought she said these eyes not yet from thee withdraw their light already in the east the amorous star illumined heaven while from her northern height great juno's rival through the dusky night her beamy radiance shot returning care had roused th' industrious hag with footstep bare and loins ungirt the sleeping fire to light and lovers thrill'd that season of despight which wont renew their tears and wake despair when my soul's hope now on the verge of fate not by th' accustomed way for that in sleep was closed and moist with griefs attain'd my heart alas how changed servant no longer weep she seem'd to say resume thy wonted state not yet thine eyes from mine are doom'd to part already in the east the star of love was flaming and that other in the north which juno's jealousy is wont to move its beautiful and lustrous rays shot forth barefooted and half clad the housewife old had stirr'd her fire and set herself to weave each tender heart the thoughtful time controll'd which evermore the lover wakes to grieve when my fond hope already at life's last came to my heart not by the wonted way where sleep its seal its dew where sorrow cast alas how changedand said or seem'd to say sight of these eyes not yet does heaven refuse then wherefore should thy tost heart courage lose o phoebus if that fond desire remains which fired thy breast near the thessalian wave if those bright tresses which such pleasure gave through lapse of years thy memory not disdains from sluggish frosts from rude inclement rains which last the while thy beams our region leave that honour'd sacred tree from peril save whose name of dear accordance waked our pains and by that amorous hope which soothed thy care what time expectant thou wert doom'd to sigh dispel those vapours which disturb our sky so shall we both behold our favorite fair with wonder seated on the grassy mead and forming with her arms herself a shade if live the fair desire apollo yet which fired thy spirit once on peneus' shore and if the bright hair loved so well of yore in lapse of years thou dost not now forget from the long frost from seasons rude and keen which last while hides itself thy kindling brow defend this consecrate and honour'd bough which snared thee erst whose slave i since have been and by the virtue of the love so dear which soothed sustain'd thee in that early strife our air from raw and lowering vapours clear so shall we see our lady to new life restored her seat upon the greensward take where her own graceful arms a sweet shade o'er her make alone and lost in thought the desert glade measuring i roam with ling'ring steps and slow and still a watchful glance around me throw anxious to shun the print of human tread no other means i find no surer aid from the world's prying eye to hide my woe so well my wild disorder'd gestures show and love lorn looks the fire within me bred that well i deem each mountain wood and plain and river knows what i from man conceal what dreary hues my life's fond prospects dim yet whate'er wild or savage paths i've ta'en where'er i wander love attends me still soft whisp'ring to my soul and i to him alone and pensive near some desert shore far from the haunts of men i love to stray and cautiously my distant path explore where never human footsteps mark'd the way thus from the public gaze i strive to fly and to the winds alone my griefs impart while in my hollow cheek and haggard eye appears the fire that burns my inmost heart but ah in vain to distant scenes i go no solitude my troubled thoughts allays methinks e'en things inanimate must know the flame that on my soul in secret preys whilst love unconquer'd with resistless sway still hovers round my path still meets me on my way alone and pensive the deserted plain with tardy pace and sad i wander by and mine eyes o'er it rove intent to fly where distant shores no trace of man retain no help save this i find some cave to gain where never may intrude man's curious eye lest on my brow a stranger long to joy he read the secret fire which makes my pain for here methinks the mountain and the flood valley and forest the strange temper know of my sad life conceal'd from others' sight yet where where shall i find so wild a wood a way so rough that there love cannot go communing with me the long day and night had i believed that death could set me free from the anxious amorous thoughts my peace that mar with these my own hands which yet stainless are life had i loosed long hateful grown to me yet for i fear 'twould but a passage be from grief to grief from old to other war hither the dark shades my escape that bar i still remain nor hope relief to see high time it surely is that he had sped the fatal arrow from his pitiless bow in others' blood so often bathed and red and i of love and death have pray'd it so he listens not but leaves me here half dead nor cares to call me to himself below oh had i deem'd that death had freed my soul from love's tormenting overwhelming thought to crush its aching burthen i had sought my wearied life had hasten'd to its goal my shivering bark yet fear'd another shoal to find one tempest with another bought thus poised 'twixt earth and heaven i dwell as naught not daring to assume my life's control but sure 'tis time that death's relentless bow had wing'd that fatal arrow to my heart so often bathed in life's dark crimson tide but though i crave he would this boon bestow he to my cheek his impress doth impart and yet o'erlooks me in his fearful stride the thread on which my weary life depends so fragile is and weak if none kind succour lends soon 'neath the painful burden will it break since doom'd to take my sad farewell of her in whom begins and ends my bliss one hope to stir my sinking spirit from its black despair whispers though lost awhile that form so dear and fair sad soul the trial bear for thee e'en yet the sun may brightly shine and days more happy smile once more the lost loved treasure may be thine this thought awhile sustains me but again to fail me and forsake in worse excess of pain time flies apace the silent hours and swift so urge his journey on short span to me is left even to think how quick to death i run scarce in the orient heaven yon mountain crest smiles in the sun's first ray when in the adverse west his long round run we see his light decay so small of life the space so frail and clogg'd with woe to mortal man below that when i find me from that beauteous face thus torn by fate's decree unable at a wish with her to be so poor the profit that old comforts give i know not how i brook in such a state to live each place offends save where alone i see those eyes so sweet and bright which still shall bear the key of the soft thoughts i hide from other sight and though hard exile harder weighs on me whatever mood betide i ask no theme beside for all is hateful that i since have seen what rivers and what heights what shores and seas between me rise and those twin lights which made the storm and blackness of my days one beautiful serene to which tormented memory still strays free as my life then pass'd from every care so hard and heavy seems my present lot to bear alas selfparleying thus i but renew the warm wish in my mind which first within it grew the day i left my better half behind if by long absence love is quench'd then who guides me to the old bait whence all my sorrows date why rather not my lips in silence seal'd by finest crystal ne'er were hidden tints reveal'd so faithfully and fair as my sad spirit naked lays and bare its every secret part and the wild sweetness thrilling in my heart through eyes which restlessly o'erfraught with tears seek her whose sight alone with instant gladness cheers strange pleasureyet so often that within the human heart to reign is foundto woo and win each new brief toy that men most sigh to gain and i am one from sadness who relief so draw as if it still my study were to fill these eyes with softness and this heart with grief as weighs with me in chief nay rather with sole force the language and the light of those dear eyes to urge me on that course so where its fullest source long sorrow finds i fix my often sight and thus my heart and eyes like sufferers be which in love's path have been twin pioneers to me the golden tresses which should make i ween the sun with envy pine and the sweet look serene where love's own rays so bright and burning shine that ere its time they make my strength decline each wise and truthful word rare in the world which late she smiling gave no more are seen or heard but this of all my fate is hardest to endure that here i am denied the gentle greeting angellike and pure which still to virtue's side inclined my heart with modest magic lure so that in sooth i nothing hope again of comfort more than this how best to bear my pain andwith fit ecstacy my loss to mourn the soft hand's snowy charm the finelyrounded arm the winning ways by turns that quiet scorn chaste anger proud humility adorn the fair young breast that shrined intellect pure and high are now all hid the rugged alp behind my trust were vain to try and see her ere i die for though awhile he dare such dreams indulge hope ne'er can constant be but falls back in despair her whom heaven honours there again to see where virtue courtesy in her best mix and where so oft i pray my future home to fix my song if thou shalt see our common lady in that dear retreat we both may hope that she will stretch to thee her fair and fav'ring hand whence i so far am bann'd touch touch it not but reverent at her feet tell her i will be there with earliest speed a man of flesh and blood or else a spirit freed orso my friend was never stream nor lake nor sea in whose broad lap all rivers fall nor shadow of high hill or wood or wall nor heavenobscuring clouds which torrents make nor other obstacles my grief so wake whatever most that lovely face may pall as hiding the bright eyes which me enthrall that veil which bids my heart now burn or break and whether by humility or pride their glance extinguishing mine every joy conducts me prematurely to my tomb also my soul by one fair hand is tried cunning and careful ever to annoy 'gainst my poor eyes a rock that has become so much i fear to encounter her bright eye alway in which my death and love reside that as a child the rod its glance i fly though long the time has been since first i tried and ever since so wearisome or high no place has been where strong will has not hied her shunning at whose sight my senses die and cold as marble i am laid aside wherefore if i return to see you late sure 'tis no fault unworthy of excuse that from my death awhile i held aloof at all to turn to what men shun their fate and from such fear my harass'd heart to loose of its true faith are ample pledge and proof if love or death no obstacle entwine with the new web which here my fingers fold and if i 'scape from beauty's tyrant hold while natural truth with truth reveal'd i join perchance a work so double will be mine between our modern style and language old that timidly i speak with hope though bold even to rome its growing fame may shine but since our labour to perfèct at last some of the blessed threads are absent yet which our dear father plentifully met wherefore to me thy hands so close and fast against their use be prompt of aid and free and rich our harvest of fair things shall be when from its proper soil the tree is moved which phoebus loved erewhile in human form grim vulcan at his labour sighs and sweats renewing ever the dread bolts of jove who thunders now now speaks in snow and rain nor julius honoureth than janus more earth moans and far from us the sun retires since his dear mistress here no more is seen then mars and saturn cruel stars resume their hostile rage orion arm'd with clouds the helm and sails of stormtost seamen breaks to neptune and to juno and to us vext Æolus proves his power and makes us feel how parts the fair face angels long expect but when her sweet smile modest and benign no longer hides from us its beauties rare at the spent forge his stout and sinewy arms plieth that old sicilian smith in vain for from the hands of jove his bolts are taken temper'd in Ætna to extremest proof and his cold sister by degrees grows calm and genial in apollo's kindling beams moves from the rosy west a summer breath which safe and easy wafts the seaward bark and wakes the sweet flowers in each grassy mead malignant stars on every side depart dispersed before that bright enchanting face for which already many tears are shed nine times already had latona's son look'd from the highest balcony of heaven for her who whilom waked his sighs in vain and sighs as vain now wakes in other breasts then seeking wearily nor knowing where she dwelt or far or near and why delay'd he show'd himself to us as one insane for grief who cannot find some loved lost thing and thus for clouds of sorrow held aloof saw not the fair face turn which if i live in many a page shall praised and honour'd be the misery of her loss so changed her mien that her bright eyes were dimm'd for once with tears thereon its former gloom the air resumed he who for empire at pharsalia threw reddening its beauteous plain with civil gore as pompey's corse his conquering soldiers bore wept when the wellknown features met his view the shepherd youth who fierce goliath slew had long rebellious children to deplore and bent in generous grief the brave saul o'er his shame and fall when proud gilboa knew but you whose cheek with pity never paled who still have shields at hand to guard you well against love's bow which shoots its darts in vain behold me by a thousand deaths assail'd and yet no tears of thine compassion tell but in those bright eyes anger and disdain my foe in whom you see your own bright eyes adored by love and heaven with honour due with beauties not its own enamours you sweeter and happier than in mortal guise me by its counsel lady from your breast my chosen cherish'd home your scorn expell'd in wretched banishment perchance not held worthy to dwell where you alone should rest but were i fasten'd there with strongest keys that mirror should not make you at my cost severe and proud yourself alone to please remember how narcissus erst was lost his course and thine to one conclusion lead of flower so fair though worthless here the mead my mirror'd foe reflects alas so fair those eyes which heaven and love have honour'd too yet not his charms thou dost enamour'd view but all thine own and they beyond compare o lady thou hast chased me at its prayer from thy heart's throne where i so fondly grew o wretched exile though too well i knew a reign with thee i were unfit to share but were i ever fix'd thy bosom's mate a flattering mirror should not me supplant and make thee scorn me in thy selfdelight thou surely must recall narcissus' fate but if like him thy doom should thee enchant what mead were worthy of a flower so bright those golden tresses teeth of pearly white those cheeks' fair roses blooming to decay do in their beauty to my soul convey the poison'd arrows from my aching sight thus sad and briefly must my days take flight for life with woe not long on earth will stay but more i blame that mirror's flattering sway which thou hast wearied with thy selfdelight its power my bosom's sovereign too hath still'd who pray'd thee in my suitnow he is mute since thou art captured by thyself alone death's seeds it hath within my heart instill'd for lethe's stream its form doth constitute and makes thee lose each image but thine own the gold and pearls the lily and the rose which weak and dry in winter wont to be are rank and poisonous arrowshafts to me as my sorestricken bosom aptly shows thus all my days now sadly shortly close for seldom with great grief long years agree but in that fatal glass most blame i see that weary with your oft selfliking grows it on my lord placed silence when my suit he would have urged but seeing your desire end in yourself alone he soon was mute 'twas fashion'd in hell's wave and o'er its fire and tinted in eternal lethe thence the spring and secret of my death commence he desires again to gaze on the eyes of laura i now perceived that from within me fled those spirits to which you their being lend and since by nature's dictates to defend themselves from death all animals are made the reins i loosed with which desire i stay'd and sent him on his way without a friend there whither day and night my course he'd bend though still from thence by me reluctant led and me ashamed and slow along he drew to see your eyes their matchless influence shower which much i shun afraid to give you pain yet for myself this once i'll live such power has o'er this wayward life one look from you then die unless desire prevails again because the powers that take their life from you already had i felt within decay and because nature death to shield or slay arms every animal with instinct true to my longcurb'd desire the rein i threw and turn'd it in the old forgotten way where fondly it invites me night and day though 'gainst its will another i pursue and thus it led me back ashamed and slow to see those eyes with love's own lustre rife which i am watchful never to offend thus may i live perchance awhile below one glance of yours such power has o'er my life which sure if i oppose desire shall end if fire was never yet by fire subdued if never flood fell dry by frequent rain but like to like if each by other gain and contraries are often mutual food love who our thoughts controllest in each mood through whom two bodies thus one soul sustain how why in her with such unusual strain make the want less by wishes long renewed perchance as falleth the broad nile from high deafening with his great voice all nature round and as the sun still dazzles the fix'd eye so with itself desire in discord found loses in its impetuous object force as the too frequent spur oft checks the course although from falsehood i did thee restrain with all my power and paid thee honour due ungrateful tongue yet never did accrue honour from thee but shame and fierce disdain most art thou cold when most i want the strain thy aid should lend while i for pity sue and all thy utterance is imperfect too when thou dost speak and as the dreamer's vain ye too sad tears throughout each lingering night upon me wait when i alone would stay but needed by my peace you take your flight and all so prompt anguish and grief t' impart ye sighs then slow and broken breathe your way my looks alone truly reveal my heart with all my power lest falsehood should invade i guarded thee and still thy honour sought ungrateful tongue who honour ne'er hast brought but still my care with rage and shame repaid for though to me most requisite thine aid when mercy i would ask availeth nought still cold and mute and e'en to words if wrought they seem as sounds in sleep by dreamers made and ye sad tears o' nights when i would fain be left alone my sure companions flow but summon'd for my peace ye soon depart ye too mine anguish'd sighs so prompt to pain then breathe before her brokenly and slow and my face only speaks my suffering heart in that still season when the rapid sun drives down the west and daylight flies to greet nations that haply wait his kindling flame in some strange land alone her weary feet the timeworn pilgrim finds with toil fordone yet but the more speeds on her languid frame her solitude the same when night has closed around yet has the wanderer found a deep though short forgetfulness at last of every woe and every labour past but ah my grief that with each moment grows as fast and yet more fast day urges on is heaviest at its close when phoebus rolls his everlasting wheels to give night room and from encircling wood broader and broader yet descends the shade the labourer arms him for his evening trade and all the weight his burthen'd heart conceals lightens with glad discourse or descant rude then spreads his board with food such as the forest hoar to our first fathers bore by us disdain'd yet praised in hall and bower but let who will the cup of joyance pour i never knew i will not say of mirth but of repose an hour when phoebus leaves and stars salute the earth yon shepherd when the mighty star of day he sees descending to its western bed and the wide orient all with shade embrown'd takes his old crook and from the fountain head green mead and beechen bower pursues his way calling with welcome voice his flocks around then far from human sound some desert cave he strows with leaves and verdant boughs and lays him down without a thought to sleep ah cruel lovethen dost thou bid me keep my idle chase the airy steps pursuing of her i ever weep who flies me still my endless toil renewing e'en the rude seaman in some cave confined pillows his head as daylight quits the scene on the hard deck with vilest mat o'erspread and when the sun in orient wave serene bathes his resplendent front and leaves behind those antique pillars of his boundless bed forgetfulness has shed o'er man and beast and flower her mild restoring power but my determined grief finds no repose and every day but aggravates the woes of that remorseless flood that ten long years flowing yet ever flows nor know i what can check its ceaseless tears what time towards the western skies the sun with parting radiance flies and other climes gilds with expected light some aged pilgrim dame who strays alone fatigued through pathless ways hastens her step and dreads the approach of night then the day's journey o'er she'll steep her sense awhile in grateful sleep forgetting all the pain and peril past but i alas find no repose each sun to me brings added woes while light's eternal orb rolls from us fast when the sun's wheels no longer glow and hills their lengthen'd shadows throw the hind collects his tools and carols gay then spreads his board with frugal fare such as those homely acorns were which all revere yet casting them away let those who pleasure can enjoy in cheerfulness their hours employ while i of all earth's wretches most unblest whether the sun fierce darts his beams whether the moon more mildly gleams taste no delight no momentary rest when the swain views the star of day quench in the pillowing waves its ray and scatter darkness o'er the eastern skies rising his custom'd crook he takes the beechwood fountain plain forsakes as calmly homeward with his flock he hies remote from man then on his bed in cot or cave with fresh leaves spread he courts soft slumber and suspense from care while thou fell love bidst me pursue that voice those footsteps which subdue my soul yet movest not th' obdurate fair lock'd in some bay to taste repose on the hard deck the sailor throws his coarse garb o'er him when the car of light granada with marocco leaves the pillars famed iberia's waves and the world's hush'd and all its race in night but never will my sorrows cease successive days their sum increase though just ten annual suns have mark'd my pain say to this bosom's poignant grief who shall administer relief say who at length shall free me from my chain and since there's comfort in the strain i see at eve along each plain and furrow'd hill the unyoked team return why at that hour will no one stay my sighs or bear my yoke away why bathed in tears must i unceasing mourn wretch that i was to fix my sight first on that face with such delight till on my thought its charms were strong imprest which force shall not efface nor art ere from this frame my soul dispart nor know i then if passion's votaries rest o hasty strain devoid of worth sad as the bard who brought thee forth show not thyself be with the world at strife from nook to nook indulge thy grief while thy lorn parent seeks relief nursing that amorous flame which feeds his life had but the light which dazzled them afar drawn but a little nearer to mine eyes methinks i would have wholly changed my form even as in thessaly her form she changed but if i cannot lose myself in her more than i havesmall mercy though it won i would today in aspect thoughtful be of harder stone than chisel ever wrought of adamant or marble cold and white perchance through terror or of jasper rare and therefore prized by the blind greedy crowd then were i free from this hard heavy yoke which makes me envy atlas old and worn who with his shoulders brings morocco night not dian to her lover was more dear when fortune 'mid the waters cold and clear gave him her naked beauties all to see than seem'd the rustic ruddy nymph to me who in yon flashing stream the light veil laved whence laura's lovely tresses lately waved i saw and through me felt an amorous chill though summer burn to tremble and to thrill spirit heroic who with fire divine kindlest those limbs awhile which pilgrim hold on earth a chieftain gracious wise and bold since rightly now the rod of state is thine rome and her wandering children to confine and yet reclaim her to the old good way to thee i speak for elsewhere not a ray of virtue can i find extinct below nor one who feels of evil deeds the shame why italy still waits and what her aim i know not callous to her proper woe indolent aged slow still will she sleep is none to rouse her found oh that my wakening hands were through her tresses wound so grievous is the spell the trance so deep loud though we call my hope is faint that e'er she yet will waken from her heavy sleep but not methinks without some better end was this our rome entrusted to thy care who surest may revive and best defend fearlessly then upon that reverend head 'mid her dishevell'd locks thy fingers spread and lift at length the sluggard from the dust i day and night who her prostration mourn for this in thee have fix'd my certain trust that if her sons yet turn and their eyes ever to true honour raise the glory is reserved for thy illustrious days her ancient walls which still with fear and love the world admires whene'er it calls to mind the days of eld and turns to look behind her hoar and cavern'd monuments above the dust of men whose fame until the world in dissolution sink can never fail her all that in one ruin now lies hurl'd hopes to have heal'd by thee its every ail o faithful brutus noble scipios dead to you what triumph where ye now are blest if of our worthy choice the fame have spread and how his laurell'd crest will old fabricius rear with joy elate that his own rome again shall beauteous be and great and if for things of earth its care heaven show the souls who dwell above in joy and peace and their mere mortal frames have left below implore thee this long civil strife may cease which kills all confidence nips every good which bars the way to many a roof where men once holy hospitable lived the den of fearless rapine now and frequent blood whose doors to virtue only are denied while beneath plunder'd saints in outraged fanes plots faction and revenge the altar stains and contrast sad and wide the very bells which sweetly wont to fling summons to prayer and praise now battle's tocsin ring pale weeping women and a friendless crowd of tender years infirm and desolate age which hates itself and its superfluous days with each blest order to religion vow'd whom works of love through lives of want engage to thee for help their hands and voices raise while our poor panicstricken land displays the thousand wounds which now so mar her frame that e'en from foes compassion they command or more if christendom thy care may claim lo god's own house on fire while not a hand moves to subdue the flame heal thou these wounds this feverish tumult end and on the holy work heaven's blessing shall descend often against our marble column high wolf lion bear proud eagle and base snake even to their own injury insult shower lifts against thee and theirs her mournful cry the noble dame who calls thee here to break away the evil weeds which will not flower a thousand years and more and gallant men there fix'd her seat in beauty and in power the breed of patriot hearts has fail'd since then and in their stead upstart and haughty now a race which ne'er to her in reverence bends her husband father thou like care from thee and counsel she attends as o'er his other works the sire of all extends 'tis seldom e'en that with our fairest scheme some adverse fortune will not mix and mar with instant ill ambition's noblest dreams but thou once ta'en thy path so walk that i may pardon her past faults great as they are if now at least she give herself the lie for never in all memory as to thee to mortal man so sure and straight the way of everlasting honour open lay for thine the power and will if right i see to lift our empire to its old proud state let this thy glory be they succour'd her when young and strong and great he in her weak old age warded the stroke of fate forth on thy way my song and where the bold tarpeian lifts his brow shouldst thou behold of others' weal more thoughtful than his own the chief by general italy revered tell him from me to whom he is but known as one to virtue and by fame endear'd till stamp'd upon his heart the sad truth be that day by day to thee with suppliant attitude and streaming eyes for justice and relief our sevenhill'd city cries bright in whose face love's conquering ensign stream'd a foreign fair so won me young and vain that of her sex all others worthless seem'd her as i follow'd o'er the verdant plain i heard a loud voice speaking from afar how lost in these lone woods his footsteps are then paused i and beneath the tall beech shade all wrapt in thought around me well survey'd till seeing how much danger block'd my way homeward i turn'd me though at noon of day that fire for ever which i thought at rest quench'd in the chill blood of my ripen'd years awakes new flames and torment in my breast its sparks were never all from what i see extinct but merely slumbering smoulder'd o'er haply this second error worse may be for by the tears which i in torrents pour grief through these eyes distill'd from my heart's core which holds within itself the spark and bait remains not as it was but grows more great what fire save mine had not been quench'd and kill'd beneath the flood these sad eyes ceaseless shed struggling 'mid oppositesso love has will'd now here now there my vain life must be led for in so many ways his snares are spread when most i hope him from my heart expell'd then most of her fair face its slave i'm held either that blind desire which life destroys counting the hours deceives my misery or even while yet i speak the moment flies promised at once to pity and to me alas what baneful shade o'erhangs and dries the seed so near its full maturity 'twixt me and hope what brazen walls arise from murderous wolves not even my fold is free ah woe is me too clearly now i find that felon love to aggravate my pain mine easy heart hath thus to hope inclined and now the maxim sage i call to mind that mortal bliss must doubtful still remain till death from earthly bonds the soul unbind counting the hours lest i myself mislead by blind desire wherewith my heart is torn e'en while i speak away the moments speed to me and pity which alike were sworn what shade so cruel as to blight the seed whence the wish'd fruitage should so soon be born what beast within my fold has leap'd to feed what wall is built between the hand and corn alas i know not but if right i guess love to such joyful hope has only led to plunge my weary life in worse distress and i remember now what once i read until the moment of his full release man's bliss begins not nor his troubles cease ever my hap is slack and slow in coming desire increasing ay my hope uncertain with doubtful love that but increaseth pain for tigerlike so swift it is in parting alas the snow black shall it be and scalding the sea waterless and fish upon the mountain the thames shall back return into his fountain and where he rose the sun shall take [his] lodging ere i in this find peace or quietness or that love or my lady right wisely leave to conspire against me wrongfully and if i have after such bitterness one drop of sweet my mouth is out of taste that all my trust and travail is but waste late to arrive my fortunes are and slow hopes are unsure desires ascend and swell suspense expectancy in me rebel but swifter to depart than tigers go tepid and dark shall be the cold pure snow the ocean dry its fish on mountains dwell the sun set in the east by that old well alike whence tigris and euphrates flow ere in this strife i peace or truce shall find ere love or laura practise kinder ways sworn friends against me wrongfully combined after such bitters if some sweet allays balk'd by long fasts my palate spurns the fare sole grace from them that falleth to my share thy weary cheek that channell'd sorrow shows my much loved lord upon the one repose more careful of thyself against love be tyrant who smiles his votaries wan to see and with the other close the lefthand path too easy entrance where his message hath in sun and storm thyself the same display because time faileth for the lengthen'd way and with the third drink of the precious herb which purges every thought that would disturb sweet in the end though sour at first in taste but me enshrine where your best joys are placed so that i fear not the grim bark of styx if with such prayer of mine pride do not mix though cruelty denies my view those charms which led me first to love to passion yet will i be true nor shall my will rebellious prove amid the curls of golden hair that wave those beauteous temples round cupid spread craftily the snare with which my captive heart he bound and from those eyes he caught the ray which thaw'd the ice that fenced my breast chasing all other thoughts away with brightness suddenly imprest but now that hair of sunny gleam ah me is ravish'd from my sight those beauteous eyes withdraw their beam and change to sadness past delight a glorious death by all is prized tis death alone shall break my chain oh be love's timid wail despised lovers should nobly suffer pain though barr'd from all which led me first to love by coldness or caprice not yet from its firm bent can passion cease the snare was set amid those threads of gold to which love bound me fast and from those bright eyes melted the long cold within my heart that pass'd so sweet the spell their sudden splendour cast its single memory still deprives my soul of every other will but now alas from me of that fine hair is ravish'd the dear sight the lost light of those twin stars chaste as fair saddens me in her flight but since a glorious death wins honour bright by death and not through grief love from such chain shall give at last relief the graceful tree i loved so long and well ere its fair boughs in scorn my flame declined beneath its shade encouraged my poor mind to bud and bloom and 'mid its sorrow swell but now my heart secure from such a spell alas from friendly it has grown unkind my thoughts entirely to one end confined their painful sufferings how i still may tell what should he say the sighing slave of love to whom my later rhymes gave hope of bliss who for that laurel has lost allbut this may poet never pluck thee more nor jove exempt but may the sun still hold in hate on each green leaf till blight and blackness wait blest be the day and blest the month the year the spring the hour the very moment blest the lovely scene the spot where first oppress'd i sunk of two bright eyes the prisoner and blest the first soft pang to me most dear which thrill'd my heart when love became its guest and blest the bow the shafts which pierced my breast and even the wounds which bosom'd thence i bear blest too the strains which pour'd through glade and grove have made the woodlands echo with her name the sighs the tears the languishment the love and blest those sonnets sources of my fame and blest that thoughtoh never to remove which turns to her alone from her alone which came blest be the year the month the hour the day the season and the time and point of space and blest the beauteous country and the place where first of two bright eyes i felt the sway blest the sweet pain of which i was the prey when newly doom'd love's sovereign law to embrace and blest the bow and shaft to which i trace the wound that to my inmost heart found way blest be the ceaseless accents of my tongue unwearied breathing my loved lady's name blest my fond wishes sighs and tears and pains blest be the lays in which her praise i sung that on all sides acquired to her fair fame and blest my thoughts for o'er them all she reigns father of heaven after the days misspent after the nights of wild tumultuous thought in that fierce passion's strong entanglement one for my peace too lovely fair had wrought vouchsafe that by thy grace my spirit bent on nobler aims to holier ways be brought that so my foe spreading with dark intent his mortal snares be foil'd and held at nought e'en now th' eleventh year its course fulfils that i have bow'd me to the tyranny relentless most to fealty most tried have mercy lord on my unworthy ills fix all my thoughts in contemplation high how on the cross this day a saviour died father of heaven despite my days all lost despite my nights in doting folly spent with that fierce passion which my bosom rent at sight of her too lovely for my cost vouchsafe at length that by thy grace i turn to wiser life and enterprise more fair so that my cruel foe in vain his snare set for my soul may his defeat discern already lord the eleventh year circling wanes since first beneath his tyrant yoke i fell who still is fiercest where we least rebel pity my undeserved and lingering pains to holier thoughts my wandering sense restore how on this day his cross thy son our saviour bore late as those eyes on my sunk cheek inclined whose paleness to the world seems of the grave compassion moved you to that greeting kind whose soft smile to my worn heart spirit gave the poor frail life which yet to me is left was of your beauteous eyes the liberal gift and of that voice angelical and mild my present state derived from them i see as the rod quickens the slow sullen child so waken'd they the sleeping soul in me thus lady of my true heart both the keys you hold in hand and yet your captive please ready to sail wherever winds may blow by me most prized whate'er to you i owe if but by angry and disdainful sign by the averted head and downcast sight by readiness beyond thy sex for flight deaf to all pure and worthy prayers of mine thou canst by these or other arts of thine 'scape from my breastwhere love on slip so slight grafts every day new boughsof such despite a fitting cause i then might well divine for gentle plant in arid soil to be seems little suited so it better were and this e'en nature dictates thence to stir but since thy destiny prohibits thee elsewhere to dwell be this at least thy care not always to sojourn in hatred there alas this heart by me was little known in those first days when love its depths explored where by degrees he made himself the lord of my whole life and claim'd it as his own i did not think that through his power alone a heart timesteel'd and so with valour stored such proof of failing firmness could afford and fell by wrong selfconfidence o'erthrown henceforward all defence too late will come save this to prove enough or little here if to these mortal prayers love lend his ear not now my prayernor can such e'er have room that with more mercy he consume my heart but in the fire that she may bear her part the overcharged air the impending cloud compress'd together by impetuous winds must presently discharge themselves in rain already as of crystal are the streams and for the fine grass late that clothed the vales is nothing now but the hoar frost and ice and i within my heart more cold than ice of heavy thoughts have such a hovering cloud as sometimes rears itself in these our vales lowly and landlock'd against amorous winds environ'd everywhere with stagnant streams when falls from soft'ning heaven the smaller rain lasts but a brief while every heavy rain and summer melts away the snows and ice when proudly roll th' accumulated streams nor ever hid the heavens so thick a cloud which overtaken by the furious winds fled not from the first hills and quiet vales but ah what profit me the flowering vales alike i mourn in sunshine and in rain suffering the same in warm and wintry winds for only then my lady shall want ice at heart and on her brow th' accustom'd cloud when dry shall be the seas the lakes and streams while to the sea descend the mountain streams as long as wild beasts love umbrageous vales o'er those bright eyes shall hang th' unfriendly cloud my own that moistens with continual rain and in that lovely breast be harden'd ice which forces still from mine so dolorous winds yet well ought i to pardon all the winds but for the love of one that 'mid two streams shut me among bright verdure and pure ice so that i pictured then in thousand vales the shade wherein i was which heat or rain esteemeth not nor sound of broken cloud but fled not ever cloud before the winds as i that day nor ever streams with rain nor ice when april's sun opens the vales [illustration castle of st angelo & st peters] upon the left shore of the tyrrhene sea where broken by the winds the waves complain sudden i saw that honour'd green again written for whom so many a page must be love ever in my soul his flame who fed drew me with memories of those tresses fair whence in a rivulet which silent there through long grass stole i fell as one struck dead lone as i was 'mid hills of oak and fir i felt ashamed to heart of gentle mould blushes suffice nor needs it other spur 'tis well at least breaking bad customs old to change from eyes to feet from these so wet by those if milder april should be met the solemn aspect of this sacred shore wakes for the misspent past my bitter sighs 'pause wretched man and turn' as conscience cries pointing the heavenward way where i should soar but soon another thought gets mastery o'er the first that so to palter were unwise e'en now the time if memory err not flies when we should wait our ladylove before i for his aim then well i apprehend within me freeze as one who sudden hears news unexpected which his soul offend returns my first thought then that disappears nor know i which shall conquer but till now within me they contend nor hope of rest allow full well i know that natural wisdom nought love 'gainst thy power in any age prevail'd for snares oft set fond oaths that ever fail'd sore proofs of thy sharp talons long had taught but lately and in me it wonder wrought with care this new experience be detail'd 'tween tuscany and elba as i sail'd on the salt sea it first my notice caught i fled from thy broad hands and by the way an unknown wanderer 'neath the violence of winds and waves and skies i helpless lay when lo thy ministers i knew not whence who quickly made me by fresh stings to feel ill who resists his fate or would conceal me wretched for i know not whither tend the hopes which have so long my heart betray'd if none there be who will compassion lend wherefore to heaven these often prayers for aid but if belike not yet denied to me that ere my own life end these sad notes mute shall be let not my lord conceive the wish too free yet once amid sweet flowers to touch the string reason and right it is that love i sing reason indeed there were at last that i should sing since i have sigh'd so long and late but that for me 'tis vain such art to try brief pleasures balancing with sorrows great could i by some sweet verse but cause to shine glad wonder and new joy within those eyes divine bliss o'er all other lovers then were mine but more if frankly fondly i could say my lady asks i therefore wake the lay delicious dangerous thoughts that to begin a theme so high have gently led me thus you know i ne'er can hope to pass within our lady's heart so strongly steel'd from us she will not deign to look on thing so low nor may our language win aught of her care since heaven ordains it so and vainly to oppose must irksome grow even as i my heart to stone would turn so in my verse would i be rude and stern what do i say where am imy own heart and its misplaced desires alone deceive though my view travel utmost heaven athwart no planet there condemns me thus to grieve why if the body's veil obscure my sight blame to the stars impart or other things as bright within me reigns my tyrant day and night since for his triumph me a captive took her lovely face and lustrous eyes' dear look while all things else in nature's boundless reign came good from the eternal master's mould i look for such desert in me in vain me the light wounds that i around behold to the true splendour if i turn at last my eye would shrink in pain whose own fault o'er it cast such film and not the fatal day long past when first her angel beauty met my view in the sweet season when my life was new since human life is frail and genius trembles at the lofty theme i little confidence in either place but let my tender wail there where it ought deserved attention claim that wail which e'en in silence we may trace o beauteous eyes where love doth nestling stay to you i turn my insufficient lay unapt to flow but passion's goad i feel and he of you who sings such courteous habit by the strain is taught that borne on amorous wings he soars above the reach of vulgar thought exalted thus i venture to reveal what long my cautious heart has labour'd to conceal yes well do i perceive to you how wrongful is my scanty praise yet the strong impulse cannot be withstood that urges since i view'd what fancy to the sight before ne'er gave what ne'er before graced mine or higher lays bright authors of my sadlypleasing state that you alone conceive me well i know when to your fierce beams i become as snow your elegant disdain haply then kindles at my worthless strain did not this dread create some mitigation of my bosom's heat death would be bliss for greater joy 'twould give with them to suffer death without them than to live if not consumèd quite i the weak object of a flame so strong 'tis not that safety springs from native might but that some fear restrains which chills the current circling through my veins strengthening this heart that it may suffer long o hills o vales o forests floods and fields ye who have witness'd how my sad life flows oft have ye heard me call on death for aid ah state surcharged with woes to stay destroys and flight no succour yields but had not higher dread withheld some sudden effort i had made to end my sorrows and protracted pains of which the beauteous cause insensible remains why lead me grief astray from my first theme to chant a different lay let me proceed where pleasure may invite 'tis not of you i 'plain o eyes beyond compare serenely bright nor yet of him who binds me in his chain ye clearly can behold the hues that love scatters ofttime on my dejected face and fancy may his inward workings trace there where whole nights and days he rules with power derived from your bright rays what rapture would ye prove if you dear lights upon yourselves could gaze but frequent as you bend your beams on me what influence you possess you in another see oh if to you were known that beauty which i sing immense divine as unto him on whom its glories shine the heart had then o'erflown with joy unbounded such as is denied unto that nature which its acts doth guide how happy is the soul for you that sighs celestial lights which lend a charm to life and make me bless what else i should not prize ah why so seldom why afford what ne'er can cause satiety more often to your sight why not bring love who holds me constant strife and why so soon of joys despoil me quite which ever and anon my tranced soul delight yes 'debted to your grace frequent i feel throughout my inmost soul unwonted floods of sweetest rapture roll relieving so the mind that all oppressive thoughts are left behind and of a thousand only one has place for which alone this life is dear to me oh might the blessing of duration prove not equall'd then could my condition be but this would haply move in others envy in myself vain pride that pain should be allied to pleasure is alas decreed above then stifling all the ardour of desire homeward i turn my thoughts and in myself retire so sweetly shines reveal'd the amorous thought within your soul which dwells that other joys it from my heart expels hence i aspire to frame lays whereon hope may build a deathless name when in the tomb my dust shall lie conceal'd at your approach anguish and sorrow fly these as your beams retire again draw nigh yet outward acts their influence ne'er betray for doting memory dwells on the past and chases them away whatever then of worth my genius ripens owes to you its birth to you all honour and all praise is due myself a barren soil and cultured but by you thy strains o song appease me not but fire chanting a theme that wings my wild desire trust me thou shalt ere long a sistersong acquire since mortal life is frail and my mind shrinks from lofty themes deterr'd but small the trust which i in either feel yet hope i that my wail which vainly i in silence would conceal shall where i wish where most it ought be heard beautiful eyes wherein love makes his nest to you my song its feeble descant turns slow of itself but now by passion spurr'd who sings of you is blest and from his theme such courteous habit learns that borne on wings of love proudly he soars each viler thought above encouraged thus what long my harass'd heart has kept conceal'd i venture to impart yet do i know full well how much my praise must wrongful prove to you but how the great desire can i oppose which ever in me grows since what surpasses thought 'twas mine to view though that nor others' wit nor mine can tell eyes guilty authors of my cherish'd pain that you alone can judge me well i know when from your burning beams i melt like snow haply your sweet disdain offence in my unworthiness may see ah were there not such fear to calm the heat with which i kindle near 'twere bliss to die for better far to me were death with them than life without could be if yet not wasted quite so frail a thing before so fierce a flame 'tis not from my own strength that safety came but that some fear gives might freezing the warm blood coursing through its veins to my poor heart better to bear the strife o valleys hills o forests floods and plains witnesses of my melancholy life for death how often have ye heard me pray ah miserable fate where flight avails not though 'tis death to stay but if a dread more great restrain'd me not despair would find a way speedy and short my lingering pains to close hers then the crime who still no mercy shows why thus astray o grief lead me to speak what i would leave unsaid leave me where pleasure me impels to tread not now my song complains of you sweet eyes serene beyond belief nor yet of him who binds me in such chains right well may you observe the varying hues which o'er my visage oft the tyrant strews and thence may guess what war within he makes where night and day he reigns strong in the power which from your light he takes blessèd ye were as bright save that from you is barr'd your own dear sight yet often as to me those orbs you turn what they to others are you well may learn if as to us who gaze were known to you the charms incredible and heavenly of which i sing the praise no measured joy would swell your heart and haply therefore 'tis denied unto the power which doth their motions guide happy the soul for you which breathes the sigh best lights of heaven for whom i grateful bless this life which has for me no other joy alas so seldom why give me what i can ne'er too much possess why not more often see the ceaseless havoc which love makes of me and why that bliss so quickly from me steal from time to time which my rapt senses feel yes thanks great thanks to you from time to time i feel through all my soul a sweetness so unusual and new that every marring care and gloomy vision thence begins to roll so that from all one only thought is there thatthat alone consoles me life to bear and could but this my joy endure awhile nought earthly could methinks then match my state yet such great honour might envy in others pride in me excite thus still it seems the fate of man that tears should chase his transient smile and checking thus my burning wishes i back to myself return to muse and sigh the amorous anxious thought which reigns within you flashes so on me that from my heart it draws all other joy whence works and words so wrought find scope and issue that i hope to be immortal made although all flesh must die at your approach ennui and anguish fly with your departure they return again but memory on the past which doting dwells denies them entrance then so that no outward act their influence tells thus if in me is nurst any good fruit from you the seed came first to you if such appear the praise is due barren myself till fertilized by you thy strains appease me not o song but rather fire me still that theme to sing where centre all my thoughtstherefore ere long a sister ode to join thee will i bring lady in your bright eyes soft glancing round i mark a holy light pointing the arduous way that heavenward lies and to my practised sight from thence where love enthroned asserts his might visibly palpably the soul beams forth this is the beacon guides to deeds of worth and urges me to seek the glorious goal this bids me leave behind the vulgar throng nor can the human tongue tell how those orbs divine o'er all my soul exert their sweet control both when hoar winter's frosts around are flung and when the year puts on his youth again jocund as when this bosom first knew pain oh if in that high sphere from whence the eternal ruler of the stars in this excelling work declared his might all be as fair and bright loose me from forth my darksome prison here that to so glorious life the passage bars then in the wonted tumult of my breast i hail boon nature and the genial day that gave me being and a fate so blest and her who bade hope beam upon my soul for till then burthensome was life itself become but now elate with touch of selfesteem high thoughts and sweet within that heart arise of which the warders are those beauteous eyes no joy so exquisite did love or fickle fortune ere devise in partial mood for favour'd votaries but i would barter it for one dear glance of those angelic eyes whence springs my peace as from its living root o vivid lustre of power absolute o'er all my beingsource of that delight by which consumed i sink a willing prey as fades each lesser ray before your splendour more intense and bright so to my raptured heart when your surpassing sweetness you impart no other thought of feeling may remain where you with love himself despotic reign all sweet emotions e'er by happy lovers felt in every clime together all may not with mine compare when as from time to time i catch from that dark radiance rich and deep a ray in which disporting love is seen and i believe that from my cradled sleep by heaven provided this resource hath been 'gainst adverse fortune and my nature frail wrong'd am i by that veil and the fair hand which oft the light eclipse that all my bliss hath wrought and whence the passion struggling on my lips both day and night to vent the breast o'erfraught still varying as i read her varying thought for that with pain i find not nature's poor endowments may alone render me worthy of a look so kind i strive to raise my mind to match with the exalted hopes i own and fires though all engrossing pure as mine if prone to good averse to all things base contemner of what worldlings covet most i may become by long selfdiscipline haply this humble boast may win me in her fair esteem a place for sure the end and aim of all my tears my sorrowing heart's sole claim were the soft trembling of relenting eyes the generous lover's last best dearest prize my lay thy sistersong is gone before and now another in my teeming brain prepares itself whence i resume the strain since then by destiny i am compell'd to sing the strong desire which here condemns me ceaselessly to sigh may love whose quenchless fire excites me be my guide and point the way and in the sweet task modulate my lay but gently be it lest th' o'erpowering theme inflame and sting me lest my fond heart may dissolve in too much softness which i deem from its sad state may be for in mehence my terror and distress not now as erst i see judgment to keep my mind's great passion less nay rather from mine own thoughts melt i so as melts before the summer sun the snow at first i fondly thought communing with mine ardent flame to win some brief repose some time of truce within this was the hope which brought me courage what i suffer'd to explain now now it leaves me martyr to my pain but still continuing mine amorous song must i the lofty enterprise maintain so powerful is the wish that in me glows that reason which so long restrain'd it now no longer can oppose then teach me love to sing in such frank guise that ever if the ear of my sweet foe should chance the notes to hear pity i ask no more may in her spring if as in other times when kindled to true virtue was mankind the genius energy of man could find entrance in divers climes mountains and seas o'erpassing seeking there honour and culling oft its garland fair mine were such wish not mine such need would be from shore to shore my weary course to trace since god and love and nature deign for me each virtue and each grace in those dear eyes where i rejoice to place in life to them must i turn as to founts whence peace and safety swell and e'en were death which else i fear not nigh their sight alone would teach me to be well as vex'd by the fierce wind the weary sailor lifts at night his gaze to the twin lights which still our pole displays so in the storms unkind of love which i sustain in those bright eyes my guiding light and only solace lies but e'en in this far more is due to theft which taught by love from time to time i make of secret glances than their gracious gift yet that though rare and slight makes me from them perpetual model take since first they blest my sight nothing of good without them have i tried placing them over me to guard and guide because mine own worth held itself but light never the full effect can i imagine and describe it less which o'er my heart those soft eyes still possess as worthless i reject and mean all other joys that life confers e'en as all other beauties yield to hers a tranquil peace alloy'd by no distress such as in heaven eternally abides moves from their lovely and bewitching smile so could i gaze the while love at his sweet will governs them and guides e'en though the sun were nigh resting above us on his onward wheel on her intensely with undazzled eye nor of myself nor others think or feel ah that i should desire things that can never in this world be won living on wishes hopeless to acquire yet were the knot undone wherewith my weak tongue love is wont to bind checking its speech when her sweet face puts on all its great charms then would i courage find words on that point so apt and new to use as should make weep whoe'er might hear the tale but the old wounds i bear stamp'd on my tortured heart such power refuse then grow i weak and pale and my blood hides itself i know not where nor as i was remain i hence i know love dooms my death and this the fatal blow farewell my song already do i see heavily in my hand the tired pen move from its long dear discourse with her i love not so my thoughts from communing with me i weary me alway with questions keen how why my thoughts ne'er turn from you away wherefore in life they still prefer to stay when they might flee this sad and painful scene and how of the fine hair the lovely mien of the bright eyes which all my feelings sway calling on your dear name by night and day my tongue ne'er silent in their praise has been and how my feet not tender are nor tired pursuing still with many a useless pace of your fair footsteps the elastic trace and whence the ink the paper whence acquired fill'd with your memories if in this i err not art's defect but love's own fault it were the bright eyes which so struck my fenceless side that they alone which harm'd can heal the smart beyond or power of herbs or magic art or stone which oceans from our shores divide the chance of other love have so denied that one sweet thought alone contents my heart from following which if ne'er my tongue depart pity the guided though you blame the guide these are the bright eyes which in every land but most in its own shrine my heart adored have spread the triumphs of my conquering lord these are the same bright eyes which ever stand burning within me e'en as vestal fires in singing which my fancy never tires not all the spells of the magician's art not potent herbs nor travel o'er the main but those sweet eyes alone can soothe my pain and they which struck the blow must heal the smart those eyes from meaner love have kept my heart content one single image to retain and censure but the medium wild and vain if ill my words their honey'd sense impart these are those beauteous eyes which never fail to prove love's conquest wheresoe'er they shine although my breast hath oftenest felt their fire these are those beauteous eyes which still assail and penetrate my soul with sparks divine so that of singing them i cannot tire by promise fair and artful flattery me love contrived in prison old to snare and gave the keys to her my foe in care who in selfexile dooms me still to lie alas his wiles i knew not until i was in their power so sharp yet sweet to bear man scarce will credit it although i swear that i regain my freedom with a sigh and as true suffering captives ever do carry of my sore chains the greater part and on my brow and eyes so writ my heart that when she witnesseth my cheek's wan hue a sigh shall own if right i read his face between him and his tomb but small the space had policletus seen her or the rest who in past time won honour in this art a thousand years had but the meaner part shown of the beauty which o'ercame my breast but simon sure in paradise the blest whence came this noble lady of my heart saw her and took this wond'rous counterpart which should on earth her lovely face attest the work indeed was one in heaven alone to be conceived not wrought by fellowmen over whose souls the body's veil is thrown 'twas done of grace and fail'd his pencil when to earth he turn'd our cold and heat to bear and felt that his own eyes but mortal were had polycletus in proud rivalry on her his model gazed a thousand years not half the beauty to my soul appears in fatal conquest e'er could he descry but simon thou wast then in heaven's blest sky ere she my fair one left her native spheres to trace a loveliness this world reveres was thus thy task from heaven's reality yesthine the portrait heaven alone could wake this clime nor earth such beauty could conceive where droops the spirit 'neath its earthly shrine the soul's reflected grace was thine to take which not on earth thy painting could achieve where mortal limits all the powers confine when at my word the high thought fired his mind within that masterhand which placed the pen had but the painter in his fair work then language and intellect to beauty join'd less 'neath its care my spirit since had pined which worthless held what still pleased other men and yet so mild she seems that my fond ken of peace sees promise in that aspect kind when further communing i hold with her benignantly she smiles as if she heard and well could answer to mine every word but far o'er mine thy pride and pleasure were bright warm and young pygmalion to have press'd thine image long and oft while mine not once has blest when simon at my wish the proud design conceived which in his hand the pencil placed had he while loveliness his picture graced but added speech and mind to charms divine what sighs he then had spared this breast of mine that bliss had given to higher bliss distaste for when such meekness in her look was traced 'twould seem she soon to kindness might incline but urging converse with the portray'd fair methinks she deigns attention to my prayer though wanting to reply the power of voice what praise thyself pygmalion hast thou gain'd forming that image whence thou hast obtain'd a thousand times what once obtain'd would me rejoice if of this fourteenth year wherein i sigh the end and middle with its opening vie nor air nor shade can give me now release i feel mine ardent passion so increase for love with whom my thought no medium knows beneath whose yoke i never find repose so rules me through these eyes on mine own ill too often turn'd but half remains to kill thus day by day i feel me sink apace and yet so secretly none else may trace save she whose glances my fond bosom tear scarcely till now this load of life i bear nor know how long with me will be her stay for death draws near and hastens life away who is resolved to venture his vain life on the deceitful wave and 'mid the rocks alone unfearing death in little bark can never be far distant from his end therefore betimes he should return to port while to the helm yet answers his true sail the gentle breezes to which helm and sail i trusted entering on this amorous life and hoping soon to make some better port have led me since amid a thousand rocks and the sure causes of my mournful end are not alone without but in my bark long cabin'd and confined in this blind bark i wander'd looking never at the sail which prematurely bore me to my end till he was pleased who brought me into life so far to call me back from those sharp rocks that distantly at last was seen my port as lights at midnight seen in any port sometimes from the main sea by passing bark save when their ray is lost 'mid storms or rocks so i too from above the swollen sail saw the sure colours of that other life and could not help but sigh to reach my end not that i yet am certain of that end for wishing with the dawn to be in port is a long voyage for so short a life and then i fear to find me in frail bark beyond my wishes full its every sail with the strong wind which drove me on those rocks escape i living from these doubtful rocks or if my exile have but a fair end how happy shall i be to furl my sail and my last anchor cast in some sure port but ah i burn and as some blazing bark so hard to me to leave my wonted life lord of my end and master of my life before i lose my bark amid the rocks direct to a good port its harass'd sail evil by custom as by nature frail i am so wearied with the long disgrace that much i dread my fainting in the race should let th' original enemy prevail once an eternal friend that heard my cries came to my rescue glorious in his might arm'd with allconquering love then took his flight that i in vain pursued him with my eyes but his dear words yet sounding sweetly say o ye that faint with travel see the way hopeless of other refuge come to me what grace what kindness or what destiny will give me wings as the fairfeather'd dove to raise me hence and seek my rest above so weary am i 'neath the constant thrall of mine own vile heart and the false world's taint that much i fear while on the way to faint and in the hands of my worst foe to fall well came ineffably supremely kind a friend to free me from the guilty bond but too soon upward flew my sight beyond so that in vain i strive his track to find but still his words stamp'd on my heart remain all ye who labour lo the way in me come unto me nor let the world detain oh that to me by grace divine were given wings like a dove then i away would flee and be at rest up up from earth to heaven yet was i never of your love aggrieved nor never shall while that my life doth last but of hating myself that date is past and tears continual sore have me wearied i will not yet in my grave be buried nor on my tomb your name have fixèd fast as cruel cause that did the spirit soon haste from the unhappy bones by great sighs stirr'd then if a heart of amorous faith and will content your mind withouten doing grief please it you so to this to do relief if otherwise you seek for to fulfil your wrath you err and shall not as you ween and you yourself the cause thereof have been weary i never was nor can be e'er lady while life shall last of loving you but brought alas myself in hate to view perpetual tears have bred a blank despair i wish a tomb whose marble fine and fair when this tired spirit and frail flesh are two may show your name to which my death is due if e'en our names at last one stone may share wherefore if full of faith and love a heart can of worst torture short suffice your hate mercy at length may visit e'en my smart if otherwise your wrath itself would sate it is deceived and none will credit show to love and to myself my thanks for this i owe till silver'd o'er by age my temples grow where time by slow degrees now plants his grey safe shall i never be in danger's way while love still points and plies his fatal bow i fear no more his tortures and his tricks that he will keep me further to ensnare nor ope my heart that from without he there his poisonous and ruthless shafts may fix no tears can now find issue from mine eyes but the way there so well they know to win that nothing now the pass to them denies though the fierce ray rekindle me within it burns not all her cruel and severe form may disturb not break my slumbers here playne ye myne eyes accompanye my harte for by your fault lo here is death at hand ye brought hym first into this bitter band and of his harme as yett ye felt no part but now ye shall lo here beginnes your smart wett shall you be ye shall it not withstand with weepinge teares that shall make dymm your sight and mystic clowdes shall hang still in your light blame but yourselves that kyndlyd have this brand with suche desyre to strayne that past your might but since by you the hart hath caught his harme his flamèd heat shall sometyme make you warme _p_ weep wretched eyes accompany the heart which only from your weakness death sustains _e_ weep evermore we weep with keener pains for others' error than our own we smart _p_ love entering first through you an easy part took up his seat where now supreme he reigns _e_ we oped to him the way but hope the veins first fired of him now stricken by death's dart _p_ the lots as seems to you scarce equal fall 'tween heart and eyes for you at first sight were enamour'd of your common ill and shame _e_ this is the thought which grieves us most of all for perfect judgments are on earth so rare that one man's fault is oft another's blame i always loved i love sincerely yet and to love more from day to day shall learn the charming spot where oft in grief i turn when love's severities my bosom fret my mind to love the time and hour is set which taught it each low care aside to spurn she too of loveliest face for whom i burn bids me her fair life love and sin forget who ever thought to see in friendship join'd on all sides with my suffering heart to cope the gentle enemies i love so well love now is paramount my heart to bind and save that with desire increases hope dead should i lie alive where i would dwell always in hate the window shall i bear whence love has shot on me his shafts at will because not one of them sufficed to kill for death is good when life is bright and fair but in this earthly jail its term to outwear is cause to me alas of infinite ill and mine is worse because immortal still since from the heart the spirit may not tear wretched ere this who surely ought'st to know by long experience from his onward course none can stay time by flattery or by force oft and again have i address'd it so mourner away he parteth not too soon who leaves behind him far his life's calm june instantly a good archer draws his bow small skill it needs e'en from afar to see which shaft less fortunate despised may be which to its destined sign will certain go lady e'en thus of your bright eyes the blow you surely felt pass straight and deep in me searching my life whencesuch is fate's decree eternal tears my stricken heart overflow and well i know e'en then your pity said fond wretch to misery whom passion leads be this the point at once to strike him dead but seeing now how sorrow sorrow breeds all that my cruel foes against me plot for my worse pain and for my death is not since my hope's fruit yet faileth to arrive and short the space vouchsafed me to survive betimes of this aware i fain would be swifter than light or wind from love to flee and i do flee him weak albeit and lame o' my left side where passion racked my frame though now secure yet bear i on my face of the amorous encounter signal trace wherefore i counsel each this way who comes turn hence your footsteps and if love consumes think not in present pain his worst is done for though i live of thousand scapes not one 'gainst love my enemy was strong indeed lo from his wounds e'en she is doom'd to bleed fleeing the prison which had long detain'd where love dealt with me as to him seem'd well ladies the time were long indeed to tell how much my heart its newfound freedom pain'd i felt within i could not so bereaved live e'en a day and midway on my eyes that traitor rose in so complete disguise a wiser than myself had been deceived whence oft i've said deep sighing for the past alas the yoke and chains of old to me were sweeter far than thus released to be me wretched but to learn mine ill at last with what sore trial must i now forget errors that round my path myself have set loose to the breeze her golden tresses flow'd wildly in thousand mazy ringlets blown and from her eyes unconquer'd glances shone those glances now so sparingly bestow'd and true or false meseem'd some signs she show'd as o'er her cheek soft pity's hue was thrown i whose whole breast with love's soft food was sown what wonder if at once my bosom glow'd graceful she moved with more than mortal mien in form an angel and her accents won upon the ear with more than human sound a spirit heavenly pure a living sun was what i saw and if no more 'twere seen t' unbend the bow will never heal the wound her golden tresses on the wind she threw which twisted them in many a beauteous braid in her fine eyes the burning glances play'd with lovely light which now they seldom show ah then it seem'd her face wore pity's hue yet haply fancy my fond sense betray'd nor strange that i in whose warm heart was laid love's fuel suddenly enkindled grew not like a mortal's did her step appear angelic was her form her voice methought pour'd more than human accents on the ear a living sun was what my vision caught a spirit pure and though not such still found unbending of the bow ne'er heals the wound her golden tresses to the gale were streaming that in a thousand knots did them entwine and the sweet rays which now so rarely shine from her enchanting eyes were brightly beaming andwas it fancyo'er that dear face gleaming methought i saw compassion's tint divine what marvel that this ardent heart of mine blazed swiftly forth impatient of love's dreaming there was nought mortal in her stately tread but grace angelic and her speech awoke than human voices a far loftier sound a spirit of heavena living sun she broke upon my sightwhat if these charms be fled the slackening of the bow heals not the wound the beauteous lady thou didst love so well too soon hath from our regions wing'd her flight to find i ween a home 'mid realms of light so much in virtue did she here excel thy heart's twin key of joy and woe can dwell no more with herthen reassume thy might pursue her by the path most swift and right nor let aught earthly stay thee by its spell thus from thy heaviest burthen being freed each other thou canst easier dispel and an unfreighted pilgrim seek thy sky too well thou seest how much the soul hath need ere yet it tempt the shadowy vale to quell each earthly hope since all that lives must die the lovely lady who was long so dear to thee now suddenly is from us gone and for this hope is sure to heaven is flown so mild and angellike her life was here now from her thraldom since thy heart is clear whose either key she living held alone follow where she the safe short way has shown nor let aught earthly longer interfere thus disencumber'd from the heavier weight the lesser may aside be easier laid and the freed pilgrim win the crystal gate so teaching us since all things that are made hasten to death how light must be his soul who treads the perilous pass unscathed and whole weep beauteous damsels and let cupid weep of every region weep ye lover train he who so skilfully attuned his strain to your fond cause is sunk in death's cold sleep such limits let not my affliction keep as may the solace of soft tears restrain and to relieve my bosom of its pain be all my sighs tumultuous utter'd deep let song itself and votaries of verse breathe mournful accents o'er our cino's bier who late is gone to number with the blest oh weep pistoia weep your sons perverse its choicest habitant has fled our sphere and heaven may glory in its welcome guest ye damsels pour your tears weep with you love weep all ye lovers through the peopled sphere since he is dead who while he linger'd here with all his might to do you honour strove for me this tyrant grief my prayers shall move not to contest the comfort of a tear nor check those sighs that to my heart are dear since ease from them alone it hopes to prove ye verses weepye rhymes your woes renew for cino master of the lovefraught lay e'en now is from our fond embraces torn pistoia weep and all your thankless crew your sweetest inmate now is reft away but heaven rejoice and hail your son newborn whiteto my heart love oftentimes had said write what thou seest in letters large of gold that livid are my votaries to behold and in a moment made alive and dead once in thy heart my sovran influence spread a public precedent to lovers told though other duties drew thee from my fold i soon reclaim'd thee as thy footsteps fled and if the bright eyes which i show'd thee first if the fair face where most i loved to stay thy young heart's icy hardness when i burst restore to me the bow which all obey then may thy cheek which now so smooth appears be channell'd with my daily drink of tears when reaches through the eyes the conscious heart its imaged fate all other thoughts depart the powers which from the soul their functions take a dead weight on the frame its limbs then make from the first miracle a second springs at times the banish'd faculty that brings so fleeing from itself to some new seat which feeds revenge and makes e'en exile sweet thus in both faces the pale tints were rife because the strength which gave the glow of life on neither side was where it wont to dwell i on that day these things remember'd well of that fond couple when each varying mien told me in like estate what long myself had been could i in melting verse my thoughts but throw as in my heart their living load i bear no soul so cruel in the world was e'er that would not at the tale with pity glow but ye blest eyes which dealt me the sore blow 'gainst which nor helm nor shield avail'd to spare within without behold me poor and bare though never in laments is breathed my woe but since on me your bright glance ever shines e'en as a sunbeam through transparent glass suffice then the desire without the lines faith peter bless'd and mary but alas it proves an enemy to me alone whose spirit save by you to none is known weary with expectation's endless round and overcome in this long war of sighs i hold desires in hate and hopes despise and every tie wherewith my breast is bound but the bright face which in my heart profound is stamp'd and seen where'er i turn mine eyes compels me where against my will arise the same sharp pains that first my ruin crown'd then was my error when the old way quite of liberty was bann'd and barr'd to me he follows ill who pleases but his sight to its own harm my soul ran wild and free now doom'd at others' will to wait and wend because that once it ventured to offend alas fair liberty thus left by thee well hast thou taught my discontented heart to mourn the peace it felt ere yet love's dart dealt me the wound which heal'd can never be mine eyes so charm'd with their own weakness grow that my dull mind of reason spurns the chain all worldly occupation they disdain ah that i should myself have train'd them so naught save of her who is my death mine ear consents to learn and from my tongue there flows no accent save the name to me so dear love to no other chase my spirit spurs no other path my feet pursue nor knows my hand to write in other praise but hers alas sweet liberty in speeding hence too well didst thou reveal unto my heart its careless joy ere love ensheathed his dart of whose dread wound i ne'er can lose the sense my eyes enamour'd of their grief intense did in that hour from reason's bridle start thus used to woe they have no wish to part each other mortal work is an offence no other theme will now my soul content than she who plants my death with whose blest name i make the air resound in echoes sweet love spurs me to her as his only bent my hand can trace nought other but her fame no other spot attracts my willing feet orso a curb upon thy gallant horse well may we place to turn him from his course but who thy heart may bind against its will which honour courts and shuns dishonour still sigh not for nought its praise away can take though fate this journey hinder you to make for as already voiced by general fame now is it there and none before it came amid the camp upon the day design'd enough itself beneath those arms to find which youth love valour and near blood concern crying aloud with noble fire i burn as my good lord unwillingly at home who pines and languishes in vain to come still has it been our bitter lot to prove how hope or e'er it reach fruition flies up then to that high good which never dies lift we the heartto heaven's pure bliss above on earth as in a tempting mead we rove where coil'd 'mid flowers the traitor serpent lies and if some casual glimpse delight our eyes 'tis but to grieve the soul enthrall'd by love oh then as thou wouldst wish ere life's last day to taste the sweets of calm unbroken rest tread firm the narrow shun the beaten way ah to thy friend too well may be address'd thou show'st a path thyself most apt to stray which late thy truant feet fond youth have never press'd friend as we both in confidence complain to see our illplaced hopes return in vain let that chief good which must for ever please exalt our thought and fix our happiness this world as some gay flowery field is spread which hides a serpent in its painted bed and most it wounds when most it charms our eyes at once the tempter and the paradise and would you then sweet peace of mind restore and in fair calm expect your parting hour leave the mad train and court the happy few well may it be replied o friend you show others the path from which so often you have stray'd and now stray farther than before that window where my sun is often seen refulgent and the world's at morning's hours and that where boreas blows when winter lowers and the short days reveal a clouded scene that bench of stone where with a pensive mien my laura sits forgetting beauty's powers haunts where her shadow strikes the walls or flowers and her feet press the paths or herbage green the place where love assail'd me with success and spring the fatal time that first observed revives the keen remembrance every year with looks and words that o'er me have preserved a power no length of time can render less call to my eyes the sadlysoothing tear that window where my sun is ever seen dazzling and bright and nature's at the none and that where still when boreas rude has blown in the short days the air thrills cold and keen the stone where at high noon her seat has been pensive and parleying with herself alone haunts where her bright form has its shadow thrown or trod her fairy foot the carpet green the cruel spot where first love spoil'd my rest and the new season which from year to year opes on this day the old wound in my breast the seraph face the sweet words chaste and dear which in my suffering heart are deep impress'd all melt my fond eyes to the frequent tear alas well know i what sad havoc makes death of our kind how fate no mortal spares how soon the world whom once it loved forsakes how short the faith it to the friendless bears much languishment i see small mercy wakes for the last day though now my heart prepares love not a whit my cruel prison breaks and still my cheek grief's wonted tribute wears i mark the days the moments and the hours bear the full years along nor find deceit bow'd 'neath a greater force than magic spell for fourteen years have fought with varying powers desire and reason and the best shall beat if mortal spirits here can good foretell alas i know death makes us all his prey nor aught of mercy shows to destined man how swift the world completes its circling span and faithless time soon speeds him on his way my heart repeats the blast of earth's last day yet for its grief no recompense can scan love holds me still beneath its cruel ban and still my eyes their usual tribute pay my watchful senses mark how on their wing the circling years transport their fleeter kin and still i bow enslaved as by a spell for fourteen years did reason proudly fling defiance at my tameless will to win a triumph blest if man can good foretell when egypt's traitor pompey's honour'd head to cæsar sent then records so relate to shroud a gladness manifestly great some feigned tears the specious monarch shed and when misfortune her dark mantle

a rival in my heart gave birth as suddenly his sad and rueful plight from further scrutiny a small cloud veil'd so much it ruffled him that then he fail'd o'erflowing with the sweets ineffable which

still the same coy fair for her alone my plans from what they were grew changed since nearer subject to her eyes her love alone could spur my young ambition to each hard emprize so if in longwish'd port i e'er arrive i hope for aye through her when others deem me dead in honour to survive full of first hope burning with youthful love she at her will as plainly now appears has led me many years but for one end my nature best to prove oft showing me her shadow veil and dress but never her sweet face till i who right knew not her power to bless all my green youth for these contented quite so spent that still the memory is delight since onward yet some glimpse of her is seen i now may own of late such as till then she ne'er for me had been she shows herself shooting through all my heart an icy cold so great that save in her dear arms it ne'er can thence depart not that in this cold fear i all did shrink for still my heart was to such boldness strung that to her feet i clung as if more rapture from her eyes to drink and shefor now the veil was ta'en away which barr'd my sightthus spoke me friend you see how fair i am and may ask for your years whatever fittest be lady i said so long

may not cannot be i thus began when she turn hither and in yon calm nook upon the lady look so seldom seen so little sought of man i turn'd and o'er my brow the mantling shame within me as i felt that new fire swell of conscious treason came she softly smiled i understand you well e'en as the sun's more powerful rays dispel and drive the meaner stars of heaven from sight so i less fair appear dwindling and darken'd now in her more light but not for this i bar you from my train as one in jealous fear one birth the elder she produced us sisters twain meanwhile the cold and heavy chain was burst of silence which a sense of shame had flung around my powerless tongue when i was conscious of her notice first and thus i spoke if what i hear be true bless'd be the sire and bless'd the natal day which graced our world with you blest the long years pass'd in your search away from the right path if e'er i went astray it grieves me more than haply i can show but of your state if i deserve

high and holy aim now love at length behold a youthful fair who spurns thy rule and mocking all my care 'mid two such foes is safe and fancy free thou art well arm'd 'mid flowers and verdure she in simplest robe and natural tresses found against thee haughty still and harsh to me i am thy thrall but if thy bow be sound if yet one shaft be thine in pity take vengeance upon her for our common sake

appear when my life's flight beholding i may find issue from endless fire and lingering pain the day which crowning all my wishes here of that fair face the angel air and kind shall to my longing eyes

bears my faithful friend so soon so far away there was a touching paleness on her face which chased her smiles but such sweet union made of pensive majesty and heavenly grace as if a passing cloud had veil'd her with its shade then knew i how the blessed ones above gaze on each other in their perfect bliss for never yet was look of mortal love so pure so tender so serene as this the softest glance

before some power appears to trace within me laura's face whispers her name and straight in verse i strive to picture her again but the fond effort's vain me of my solace thus doth fate deprive e'en as some babe unties its tongue in stammering guise who cannot speak yet will not silence keep so fond words i essay and listen'd be the lay by my fair foe ere in the tomb i sleep but if of beauty vain she treats me with disdain do thou o verdant shore attend my sighs let them so freely flow that all the world may know my sorrow thou at least didst not despise and well art thou aware that never foot so fair the soil e'er press'd as that which trod thee late my sunk soul and worn heart now seek thee to impart the secret griefs that on my passion wait if on thy margent green or 'midst thy flowers were seen some traces of her footsteps lingering there my wearied life 'twould cheer bitter'd with many a tear ah now what means are left to soothe my care where'er i bend mine eye what sweet serenity i feel to think here laura shone of yore each plant and scented bloom i gather seems to come from where she wander'd on the custom'd shore ofttimes in this retreat a fresh and fragrant seat she found at least so fancy's vision shows and never let truth seek th' illusion dear to break o spirit blest from whom such magic flows to thee my simple song no polish doth belong thyself art conscious of thy little worth solicit not renown throughout the busy town but dwell within the shade that gave thee birth ye limpid brooks by whose clear streams my goddess laid her tender limbs ye gentle boughs whose friendly shade gave shelter to the lovely maid ye herbs and flowers so sweetly press'd by her soft rising snowy breast ye zephyrs mild that breathed around the place where love my heart did wound now at my summons all appear and to my dying words give ear if then my destiny requires and heaven with my fate conspires that love these eyes should weeping close here let me find a soft repose so death will less my soul affright and free from dread my weary spright naked alone will dare t' essay the still unknown though beaten way pleased that her mortal part will have so safe a port so sweet a grave the cruel fair for whom i burn may one day to these shades return and smiling with superior grace her lover seek around this place and when instead of me she finds some crumbling dust toss'd by the winds she may feel pity in her breast and sighing wish me happy rest drying her eyes with her soft veil such tears must sure with heaven prevail well i remember how the flowers descended from these boughs in showers encircled in the fragrant cloud she set nor midst such glory proud these blossoms to her lap repair these fall upon her flowing hair like pearls enchased in gold they seem these on the ground these on the stream in giddy rounds these dancing say here love and laura only sway in rapturous wonder oft i said sure she in paradise was made thence sprang that bright angelic state those looks those words that heavenly gait that beauteous smile that voice divine those graces that around her shine transported i beheld the fair and sighing cried how came i here in heaven amongst th' immortal blest here let me fix and ever rest ye waters clear and fresh to whose blight wave she all her beauties gave sole of her sex in my impassion'd mind thou sacred branch so graced with sighs e'en now retraced on whose smooth shaft her heavenly form reclined herbage and flowers that bent the robe beneath whose graceful folds compress'd her pure angelic breast ye airs serene that breathe where love first taught me in her eyes his lore yet once more all attest the last sad plaintive lay my woeworn heart may pour if so i must my destiny fulfil and love to close these weeping eyes be doom'd by heaven's mysterious will oh grant that in this loved retreat entomb'd my poor remains may lie and my freed soul regain its native sky less rude shall death appear if yet a hope so dear smooth the dread passage to eternity no shade so calmserene my weary spirit finds on earth below no grave so stillso green in which my o'ertoil'd frame may rest from mortal woe yet one day haply sheso heavenly fair so kind in cruelty with careless steps may to these haunts repair and where her beaming eye met mine in days so blest a wistful glance may yet unconscious rest and seeking me around may mark among the stones a lowly mound that speaks of pity to the shuddering sense then may she breathe a sigh of power to win me mercy from above doing heaven violence allbeautiful in tears of late relenting love still dear to memory when in odorous showers scattering their balmy flowers to summer airs th' o'ershadowing branches bow'd the while with humble state in all the pomp of tribute sweets she sate wrapt in the roseate cloud now clustering blossoms deck her vesture's hem now her bright tresses gem in that allblissful day like burnish'd gold with orient pearls inwrought some strew the turfsome on the waters float some fluttering seem to say in wanton circlets toss'd here love holds sovereign sway oft i exclaim'd in awful tremor rapt surely of heavenly birth this gracious form that visits the low earth so in oblivion lapp'd was reason's power by the celestial mien the browthe accents mild the angelic smile serene that now all sense of sad reality o'erborne by transport wild alas how came i here and when i cry deeming my spirit pass'd into the sky e'en though the illusion cease in these dear haunts alone my tortured heart finds peace if thou wert graced with numbers sweet my song to match thy wish to please leaving these rocks and trees thou boldly might'st go forth and dare th' assembled throng clear fresh and dulcet streams which the fair shape who seems to me sole woman haunted at noontide fair bough so gently fit i sigh to think of it which lent a pillar to her lovely side and turf and flowers brighteyed o'er which her folded gown flow'd like an angel's down and you o holy air and hush'd where first my heart at her sweet glances gush'd give ear give ear with one consenting to my last words my last and my lamenting if 'tis my fate below and heaven will have it so that love must close these dying eyes in tears may my poor dust be laid in middle of your shade while my soul naked mounts to its own spheres the thought would calm my fears when taking out of breath the doubtful step of death for never could my spirit find a stiller port after the stormy wind nor in more calm abstracted bourne slip from my travail'd flesh and from my bones outworn perhaps some future hour to her accustom'd bower might come the untamed and yet the gentle she and where she saw me first might turn with eyes athirst and kinder joy to look again for me then oh the charity seeing amidst the stones the earth that held my bones a sigh for very love at last might ask of heaven to pardon me the past and heaven itself could not say nay as with her gentle veil she wiped the tears away how well i call to mind when from those boughs the wind shook down upon her bosom flower on flower and there she sat meekeyed in midst of all that pride sprinkled and blushing through an amorous shower some to her hair paid dower and seem'd to dress the curls queenlike with gold and pearls some snowing on her drapery stopp'd some on the earth some on the water dropp'd while others fluttering from above seem'd wheeling round in pomp and saying here reigns love how often then i said inward and fill'd with dread doubtless this creature came from paradise for at her look the while her voice and her sweet smile and heavenly air truth parted from mine eyes so that with longdrawn sighs i said as far from men how came i here and when i had forgotten and alas fancied myself in heaven not where i was and from that time till this i bear such love for the green bower i cannot rest elsewhere when love fond love commands the strain the coyest muse must sure obey love bids my wounded breast complain and whispers the melodious lay yet when such griefs restrain the muse's wing how shall she dare to soar or how attempt to sing oh could my heart express its woe how poor how wretched should i seem but as the plaintive accents flow soft comfort spreads her golden gleam and each gay scene that nature holds to view bids laura's absent charms to memory bloom anew though fate's severe decrees remove her gladsome beauties from my sight yet urged by pity friendly love bids fond reflection yield delight if lavish spring with flowerets strews the mead her lavish beauties all to fancy are displayed when to this globe the solar beams their full meridian blaze impart it pictures laura that inflames with passion's fires each human heart and when the sun completes his daily race i see her riper age complete each growing grace when milder planets warmer skies o'er winter's frozen reign prevail when groves are tinged with vernal dyes and violets scent the wanton gale those flowers the verdure then recall that day in which my laura stole this heedless heart away the blush of health that crimson'd o'er her youthful cheek her modest mien the gaygreen garment that she wore have ever dear to memory been more dear they grow as time the more inflames this tender breast o'ercome by passion's wild extremes the sun whose cheering lustre warms the bosom of yon snowclad hill seems a just emblem of the charms whose power controls my vanquish'd will when near they gild with joy this frozen heart where ceaseless winter reigns whene'er those charms depart yon sun too paints the locks of gold that play around her face so fair her face which oft as i behold prompts the soft sigh of amorous care while laura smiles allconscious of that love which from this faithful breast no time can e'er remove if to the transient storm of night succeeds a starbespangled sky and the clear raindrops catch the light glittering on all the foliage nigh methinks her eyes i view as on that day when through the envious veil they shot their magic ray with brightness making heaven more bright as then they did i see them now i see them when the morning light purples the misty mountain's brow when day declines and darkness spreads the pole methinks 'tis laura flies and sadness wraps my soul in stately jars of burnish'd gold should lilies spread their silvery pride with freshblown roses that unfold their leaves in heaven's own crimson dyed then laura's bloom i see and sunny hair flowing adown her neck than ivory whiter far the flowerets brush'd by zephyr's wing waving their heads in frolic play oft to my fond remembrance bring the happy spot the happier day in which disporting with the gale i view'd those sweet unbraided locks that all my heart subdued oh could i count those orbs that shine nightly o'er yon ethereal plain or in some scanty vase confine each drop that ocean's bounds contain then might i hope to fly from beauty's rays laura o'er flaming worlds can spread bright beauty's blaze should i all heaven all earth explore i still should lovely laura find laura whose beauties i adore is ever present to my mind she's seen in all that strikes these partial eyes and her dear name still dwells in all my tender sighs but soft my songnot thine the power to paint that neverdying flame which gilds through life the gloomy hour which nurtures this lovewasted frame for since with laura dwells my wander'd heart cheer'd by that fostering flame i brave death's ebon dart [illustration genoa] o my own italy though words are vain the mortal wounds to

on the winter and the darker day when the soul naked and alone must prove the dubious step the still unknown yet ever beaten way and through this fatal vale would you be wafted with some gentle gale put off that eager strife and fierce disdain clouds that involve our life's serene and storms that ruffle all the scene your precious hours misspent in others' pain on nobler deeds worthy yourselves bestow whether with hand or wit you raise some monument of peaceful praise some happy labour of fair love 'tis all of heaven that you can find below and opens into all above from hill to hill i roam from thought to thought with love my guide the beaten path i fly for there in vain the tranquil life is sought if 'mid the waste well forth a lonely rill or deep embosom'd a low valley lie in its calm shade my trembling heart's still and there if love so will i smile or weep or fondly hope or fear while on my varying brow that speaks the soul the wild emotions roll now dark now bright as shifting skies appear that whosoe'er has proved the lover's state would say he feels the flame nor knows his future fate on mountains high in forests drear and wide i find repose and from the throng'd resort of man turn fearfully my eyes aside at each lone step thoughts ever new arise of her i love who oft with cruel sport will mock the pangs i bear the tears the sighs yet e'en these ills i prize though bitter sweet nor would they were removed for my heart whispers me love yet has power to grant a happier hour perchance though selfdespised thou yet art loved e'en then my breast a passing sigh will heave ah when or how may i a hope so wild believe where shadows of high rocking pines dark wave i stay my footsteps and on some rude stone with thought intense her beauteous face engrave roused from the trance my bosom bathed i find with tears and cry ah whither thus alone hast thou far wander'd and whom left behind but as with fixed mind on this fair image i impassion'd rest and viewing her forget awhile my ills love my rapt fancy fills in its own error sweet the soul is blest while all around so bright the visions glide oh might the cheat endure i ask not aught beside her form portray'd within the lucid stream will oft appear or on the verdant lawn or glossy beech or fleecy cloud will gleam so lovely fair that leda's self might say her helen sinks eclipsed as at the dawn a star when cover'd by the solar ray and as o'er wilds i stray where the eye nought but savage nature meets there fancy most her brightest tints employs but when rude truth destroys the loved illusion of those dreamed sweets i sit me down on the cold rugged stone less coid less dead than i and think and weep alone where the huge mountain rears his brow sublime on which no neighbouring height its shadow flings led by desire intense the steep i climb and tracing in the boundless space each woe whose sad remembrance my torn bosom wrings tears that bespeak the heart o'erfraught will flow while viewing all below from me i cry what worlds of air divide the beauteous form still absent and still near then chiding soft the tear i whisper low haply she too has sigh'd that thou art far away a thought so sweet awhile my labouring soul will of its burthen cheat go thou my song beyond that alpine bound where the pure smiling heavens are most serene there by a murmuring stream may i be found whose gentle airs around waft grateful odours from the laurel green nought but my empty form roams here unblest there dwells my heart with her who steals it from my breast since mercy's door is closed alas to me and hopeless paths my poor life separate from her in whom i know not by what fate the guerdon lay of all my constancy my heart that lacks not other food on sighs i feed to sorrow born i live on tears nor therefore mourn i sweeter far appears my present grief than others can surmise on thy dear portrait rests alone my view which nor praxiteles nor xeuxis drew but a more bold and cunning pencil framed what shore can hide me or what distance shield if by my cruel exile yet untamed insatiate envy finds me here concealed ways apt and new to sing of love i'd find forcing from her hard heart full many a sigh and reenkindle in her frozen mind desires a thousand passionate and high o'er her fair face would see each swift change pass see her fond eyes at length where pity reigns as one who sorrows when too late alas for his own error and another's pains see the fresh roses edging that fair snow move with her breath that ivory descried which turns to marble him who sees it near see all for which in this brief life below myself i weary not but rather pride that heaven for later times has kept me here if no love is o god what fele i so and if love is what thing and which is he if love be gode from whence cometh my woe if it be wicke a wonder thinketh me when every torment and adversite that cometh of him may to me savory thinke for aye more thurst i the more that i drinke and if that at my owne lust i brenne from whence cometh my wailing and my pleinte if harme agre me whereto pleine i thenne i not nere why unwery that i feinte o quickè deth o surelè harme so quainte how may i see in me such quantite but if that i consent that so it be if 'tis not love what is it feel i then if 'tis how strange a thing sweet powers above if love be kind why does it fatal prove if cruel why so pleasing is the pain if 'tis my will to love why weep why plain if not my will tears cannot love remove o living death o rapturous pangwhy love if i consent not canst thou o'er me reign if i consent 'tis wrongfully i mourn thus on a stormy sea my bark is borne by adverse winds and with rough tempest tost thus unenlightened lost in error's maze my blind opinion ever dubious strays i'm froze by summer scorched by winter's frost love makes me as the target for his dart as snow in sunshine or as wax in flame or galedriven cloud and laura on thy name i call but thou no pity wilt impart thy radiant eyes first caused my bosom's smart no time no place can shield me from their beam from thee but ah thou treat'st it as a dream proceed the torments of my suff'ring heart each thought's an arrow and thy face a sun my passion's flame and these doth love employ to wound my breast to dazzle and destroy thy heavenly song thy speech with which i'm won all thy sweet breathings of such strong controul form the dear gale that bears away my soul me love has placed as mark before the dart as to the sun the snow as wax to fire as clouds to wind lady e'en now i tire craving the mercy which never warms thy heart from those bright eyes was aim'd the mortal blow 'gainst which nor time nor place avail'd me aught from thee alonenor let it strange be thought the sun the fire the wind whence i am so the darts are thoughts of thee thy face the sun the fire my passion such the weapons be with which at will love dazzles yet destroys thy fragrant breath and angel voicewhich won my heart that from its thrall shall ne'er be free the wind which vapourlike my frail life flies i fynde no peace and all my warre is done i feare and hope i bourne and freese lyke yse i flye above the wynde yet cannot ryse and nought i have yet all the worlde i season that looseth nor lacketh holdes me in pryson and holdes me not yet can i escape no wyse nor lets me leeve nor die at my devyce and yet of death it giveth none occasion without eye i see and without tongue i playne i desyre to perishe yet aske i health i love another and yet i hate my self i feede in sorrow and laughe in all my payne lykewyse pleaseth me both death and lyf and my delight is cawser of my greif [footnote s harrington's nugæ antiquæ] warfare i cannot wage yet know not peace i fear i hope i burn i freeze again mount to the skies then bow to earth my face grasp the whole world yet nothing can obtain his prisoner love nor frees nor will detain in toils he holds me not nor will release he slays me not nor yet will he unchain nor joy allows nor lets my sorrow cease sightless i see my fair though mute i mourn i scorn existence and yet court its stay detest myself and for another burn by grief i'm nurtured and though tearful gay death i despise and life alike i hate such lady dost thou make my wayward state whate'er most wild and new was ever found in any foreign land if viewed and valued true most likens me 'neath love's transforming hand whence the bright day breaks through alone and consortless a bird there flies who voluntary dies to live again regenerate and entire so ever my desire alone itself repairs and on the crest of its own lofty thoughts turns to our sun there melts and is undone and sinking to its first state of unrest so burns and dies yet still its strength resumes and phoenixlike afresh in force and beauty blooms where indian billows sweep a wondrous stone there is before whose strength stout navies weak to keep their binding iron sink engulf'd at length so prove i in this deep of bitter grief whom with her own hard pride that fair rock knew to guide where now my life in wreck and ruin drives thus too the soul deprives by theft my heart which once so stonelike was it kept my senses whole now far dispersed for mine o fate accurst a rock that lifeblood and not iron draws whom still i' the flesh a magnet living sweet drags to the fatal shore a certain doom to meet neath the far ethiop skies a beast is found most mild and meek of air which seems yet in her eyes danger and dool and death she still does bear much needs he to be wise to look on hers whoever turns his mien although her eyes unseen all else securely may be viewed at will but i to mine own ill run ever in rash grief though well i know my sufferings past and future still my mind its eager deaf and blind desire o'ermasters and unhinges so that in her fine eyes and sweet sainted face fatal angelic pure my cause of death i trace in the rich south there flows a fountain from the sun its name that wins this marvel still that shows boiling at night but chill when day begins cold yet more cold it grows as the sun's mounting car we nearer see so happens it with me who am alas of tears the source and seat when the bright light and sweet my only sun retires and lone and drear my eyes are left in night's obscurest reign i burn but if again the gold rays of the living sun appear my slow blood stiffens instantaneous strange within me and without i feel the frozen change another fount of fame springs in epirus which as bards have told kindles the lurking flame and the live quenches while itself is cold my soul that uncontroll'd and scathless from love's fire till now had pass'd carelessly left at last near the cold fair for whom i ceaseless sigh was kindled instantly like martyrdom ne'er known by day or night a heart of marble had to mercy shamed which first her charms inflamed her fair and frozen virtue quenched the light that thus she crushed and kindled my heart's fire well know i who have felt in long and useless ire beyond our earth's known brinks in the famed islands of the blest there be two founts of this who drinks dies smiling who of that to live is free a kindred fate heaven links to my sad life who smilingly could die for like o'erflowing joy but soon such bliss new cries of anguish stay love still who guidest my way where dim and dark the shade of fame invites not of that fount we speak which full each hour ever with larger power o'erflows when taurus with the sun unites so are my eyes with constant sorrow wet but in that season most when i my lady met should any ask my song or how or where i am to such reply where the tall mountain throws its shade in the lone vale whence sorga flows he roams where never eye save love's who leaves him not a

vale extends in whose green windings most our sea ascends from which but yesterday i wept farewell it took the righthand way the left i tried i dragg'd by force in slavery to remain it left at liberty with love its guide but patience is great comfort amid pain long habits mutually form'd declare that our communion must be brief and rare the long love that in my thought i harbour and in my heart doth keep his residence into my face pressèth with bold pretence and there campèth displaying his bannèr she that me learns to love and to suffèr and wills that my trust and lust's negligence be rein'd by reason shame and reverence with his hardiness takes displeasure wherewith love to the heart's forest he fleeth leaving his enterprise with pain and cry and there him hideth and not appearèth what may i do when my master fearèth but in the field with him to live and die for good is the life ending faithfully love that liveth and reigneth in my thought that built its seat within my captive breast clad in the arms wherein with me he fought oft in my face he doth his banner rest she that me taught to love and suffer pain my doubtful hope and eke my hot desire with shamefaced cloak to shadow and restrain her smiling grace converteth straight to ire and coward love then to the heart apace taketh his flight whereas he lurks and plains his purpose lost and dare not show his face for my lord's guilt thus faultless bide i pains yet from my lord shall not my foot remove sweet is his death that takes his end by love love in my thought who ever lives and reigns and in my heart still holds the upper place at times come forward boldly in my face there plants his ensign and his post maintains she who in love instructs us and its pains would fain that reason shame respect should chase presumptuous hope and high desire abase and at our daring scarce herself restrains love thereon to my heart retires dismay'd abandons his attempt and weeps and fears and hiding there no more my friend appears what can the liege whose lord is thus afraid more than with him till life's last gasp to dwell for who well loving dies at least dies well as when at times in summer's scorching heats lured by the light the simple insect flies as a charm'd thing into the passer's eyes whence death the one and pain the other meets thus ever i my fatal sun to greet rush to those eyes where so much sweetness lies that reason's guiding hand fierce love defies and by strong will is better judgment beat i clearly see they value me but ill and for against their torture fails my strength that i am doom'd my life to lose at length but love so dazzles and deludes me still my heart their pain and not my loss laments and blind to its own death my soul consents beneath the pleasant shade of beauteous leaves i ran for shelter from a cruel light e'en here below that burnt me from high heaven when the last snow had ceased upon the hills and amorous airs renew'd the sweet spring time and on the upland flourish'd herbs and boughs ne'er did the world behold such graceful boughs nor ever wind rustled so verdant leaves as were by me beheld in that young time so that though fearful of the ardent light i sought not refuge from the shadowing hills but of the plant accepted most in heaven a laurel then protected from that heaven whence oft enamour'd with its lovely boughs a roamer i have been through woods o'er hills but never found i other trunk nor leaves like these so honour'd with supernal light which changed not qualities with changing time wherefore each hour more firm from time to time following where i heard my call from heaven and guided ever by a soft clear light i turn'd devoted still to those first boughs or when on earth are scatter'd the sere leaves or when the sun restored makes green the hills the woods the rocks the fields the floods and hills all that is made are conquer'd changed by time and therefore ask i pardon of those leaves if after many years revolving heaven sway'd me to flee from those entangling boughs when i begun to see its better light so dear to me at first was the sweet light that willingly i pass'd o'er difficult hills but to be nearer those beloved boughs now shortening life the apt place and full time show me another path to mount to heaven and to make fruit not merely flowers and leaves other love other leaves and other light other ascent to heaven by other hills i seekin sooth 'tis timeand other boughs whene'er you speak of her in that soft tone which love himself his votaries surely taught my ardent passion to such fire is wrought that e'en the dead reviving warmth might own where'er to me she dear or kind was known there the bright lady is to mind now brought in the same bearing which to waken thought needed no sound but of my sighs alone halfturn'd i see her looking on the breeze her light hair flung so true her memories roll on my fond heart of which she keeps the keys but the surpassing bliss which floods my soul so checks my tongue to tell how queenlike there she sits as on her throne i never dare ne'er can the sun such radiance soft display piercing some cloud that would its light impair ne'er tinged some showery arch the humid air with variegated lustre half so gay as when sweetsmiling my fond heart away allbeauteous shone my captivating fair for charms what mortal can with her compare but truth impartial truth much more might say i saw young cupid saw his laughing eyes with such bewitching am'rous sweetness roll that every human glance i since despise believe dear friend i saw the wanton boy bent was his bow to wound my tender soul yet ah once more i'd view the dang'rous joy sun never rose so beautiful and bright when skies above most clear and cloudless show'd nor after rain the bow of heaven e'er glow'd with tints so varied delicate and light as in rare beauty flash'd upon my sight the day i first took up this am'rous load that face whose fellow ne'er on earth abode even my praise to paint it seems a slight then saw i love who did her fine eyes bend so sweetly every other face obscure has from that hour till now appear'd to me the boygod and his bow i saw them friend from whom life since has never been secure whom still i madly yearn again to see place me where herb and flower the sun has dried or where numb winter's grasp holds sterner sway place me where phoebus sheds a temperate ray where first he glows where rests at eventide place me in lowly state in power and pride where lour the skies or where bland zephyrs play place me where blind night rules or lengthened day in age mature or in youth's boiling tide place me in heaven or in the abyss profound on lofty height or in low vale obscure a spirit freed or to the body bound bank'd with the great or all unknown to fame i still the same will be the same endure and my trilustral sighs still breathe the same place me where phoebus burns each herb each flower or where cold snows and frost o'ercome his rays place me where rolls his car with temp'rate blaze in climes that feel not or that feel his power place me where fortune may look bright or lour mid murky airs or where soft zephyr plays place me in night in long or shortlived days where age makes sad or youth gilds ev'ry hour place me on mountains high in vallies drear in heaven on earth in depths unknown today whether life fosters still or flies this clay place me where fame is distant where she's near still will i love nor shall those sighs yet cease which thrice five years have robb'd this breast of peace place me where angry titan burns the moor and thirsty afric fiery monsters brings or where the newborn phoenix spreads her wings and troops of wond'ring birds her flight adore place me by gange or ind's empamper'd shore where smiling heavens on earth cause double springs place me where neptune's quire of syrens sings or where made hoarse through cold he leaves to roar me place where fortune doth her darlings crown a wonder or a spark in envy's eye or late outrageous fates upon me frown and pity wailing see disaster'd me affection's print my mind so deep doth prove i may forget myself but not my love o mind by ardent virtue graced and warm'd to whom my pen so oft pours forth my heart mansion of noble probity who art a tower of strength 'gainst all assault full arm'd o rose effulgent in whose foldings charm'd we view with fresh carnation snow take part o pleasure whence my wing'd ideas start to that bless'd vision which no eye unharm'd created may approachthy name if rhyme could bear to bactra and to thule's coast nile tanaïs and calpe should resound and dread olympusbut a narrower bound confines my flight and thee our native clime between the alps and apennine must boast with glowing virtue graced of warm heart known sweet spirit for whom so many a page i trace tower in high worth which foundest well thy base centre of honour perfect and alone o blushes on fresh snow like roses thrown wherein i read myself and mend apace o pleasures lifting me to that fair face brightest of all on which the sun e'er shone oh if so far its sound may reach your name on my fond verse shall travel west and east from southern nile to thule's utmost bound but such full audience since i may not claim it shall be heard in that fair land at least which apennine divides which alps and seas surround when with two ardent spurs and a hard rein passion my daily life who rules and leads from time to time the usual law exceeds that calm at least in part my spirits may gain it findeth her who on my forehead plain the dread and daring of my deep heart reads and seeth love to punish its misdeeds lighten her piercing eyes with worse disdain whereforeas one who fears the impending blow of angry joveit back in haste retires for great fears ever master great desires but the cold fire and shrinking hopes which so lodge in my heart transparent as a glass o'er her sweet face at times make gleams of grace to pass not all the streams that water the bright earth not all the trees to which its breast gives birth can cooling drop or healing balm impart to slack the fire which scorches my sad heart as one fair brook which ever weeps with me or which i praise and sing as one dear tree this only help i find amid love's strife wherefore it me behoves to live my life in arms which else from me too rapid goes thus on fresh shore

lustrous eyes at length more kind to be yet if thus honour'd wherefore do my sighs in doubt and sorrow flow signs that too truly show my anguish'd desperate life to common eyes haply if where she is my glance i bend this harass'd heart to cheer methinks that love i hear pleading my cause and see him succour lend not therefore at an end the strife i deem nor in sure rest my heart at last esteem for love most burns within when hope most pricks us on the way to win from time to time less cruelty i trace in her sweet smile and form divinely fair less clouded doth appear the heaven of her fine eyes and lovely face what then at last avail to me those sighs which from my sorrows flow and in my semblance show the life of anguish and despair i lead if towards her perchance i bend mine eyes some solace to bestow upon my bosom's woe methinks love takes my part and lends me aid yet still i cannot find the conflict stay'd nor tranquil is my heart in every state for ah my passion's heat more

as from tumultuous gloomy thoughts i fly thoughts by the force of goading passion bred nor wrathful glance of heaven so surely sped destruction to man's sight as does that eye within whose bright black orb love's deity sharpens each dart and tips with gold its head enthroned in radiance there he sits not blind quiver'd and naked or by shame just veil'd a live not fabled boy with changeful wing thence unto me he lends instruction kind and arts of verse from meaner bards conceal'd thus am i taught whate'er of love i write or sing ne'er from the black and tempesttroubled brine the weary mariner fair haven sought as shelter i from the dark restless thought whereto hot wishes spur me and incline nor mortal vision ever light divine dazzled as mine in their rare splendour caught those matchless orbs with pride and passion fraught where love aye haunts his darts to gild and fine him blind no more but quiver'd there i view naked except so far as shame conceals a winged boyno fablequick and true what few perceive he thence to me reveals so read i clearly in her eyes' dear light whate'er of love i speak whate'er i write fiercer than tiger savager than bear in human guise an angel form appears who between fear and hope from smiles to tears so tortures me that doubt becomes despair ere long if she nor welcomes me nor frees but as her wont between the two retains by the sweet poison circling through my veins my life o love will soon be on its lees no longer can my virtue worn and frail with such severe vicissitudes contend at once which burn and freeze make red and pale by flight it hopes at length its grief to end as one who hourly failing feels death nigh powerless he is indeed who cannot even die go my warm sighs go to that frozen breast burst the firm ice that charity denies and if a mortal prayer can reach the skies let death or pity give my sorrows rest go softest thoughts be all you know express'd of that unnoticed by her lovely eyes though fate and cruelty against me rise error at least and hope shall be repress'd tell her though fully you can never tell that while her days calm and serenely flow in darkness and anxiety i dwell love guides your flight my thoughts securely go fortune may change and all may yet be well if my sun's aspect not deceives my woe go burning sighs to her cold bosom go its circling ice which hinders pity rend and if to mortal prayer heaven e'er attend let death or mercy finish soon my woe go forth fond thoughts and to our lady show the love to which her bright looks never bend if still her harshness or my star offend we shall at least our hopeless error know go in some chosen moment gently say our state disquieted and dark has been even as hers pacific and serene go safe at last for love escorts your way from my sun's face if right the skies i guess well may my cruel fortune now be less the stars the elements and heaven have made with blended powers a work beyond compare all their consenting influence all their care to frame one perfect creature lent their aid whence nature views her loveliness display'd with sunlike radiance sublimely fair nor mortal eye can the pure splendour bear love sweetness in unmeasured grace array'd the very air illumed by her sweet beams breathes purest excellence and such delight that all expression far beneath it gleams no base desire lives in that heavenly light honour alone and virtuefancy's dreams never saw passion rise refined by rays so bright the stars the heaven the elements i ween put forth their every art and utmost care in that bright light as fairest nature fair whose like on earth the sun has nowhere seen so noble elegant unique her mien scarce mortal glance to rest on it may dare love so much softness and such graces rare showers from those dazzling and resistless een the atmosphere pervaded and made pure by their sweet rays kindles with goodness so thought cannot equal it nor language show here no ill wish no base desires endure but honour virtue here if ever yet has lust his death from supreme beauty met high jove to thunder ne'er was so intent so resolute great cæsar ne'er to strike that pity had not quench'd the ire of both and from their hands the accustom'd weapons shook madonna wept my lord decreed that i should see her then and there her sorrows hear so joy desire should fill me to the brim thrilling my very marrow and my bones love show'd to me nay sculptured on my heart that sweet and sparkling tear and those soft words wrote with a diamond on its inmost core where with his constant and ingenious keys he still returneth often to draw thence true tears of mine and long and heavy sighs on earth reveal'd the beauties of the skies angelic features it was mine to hail features which wake my mingled joy and wail while all besides like dreams or shadows flies and fill'd with tears i saw those two bright eyes which oft have turn'd the sun with envy pale and from those lips i heardoh such a tale as might awake brute nature's sympathies wit pity excellence and grief and love with blended plaint so sweet a concert made as ne'er was given to mortal ear to prove and heaven itself such mute attention paid that not a breath disturb'd the listening grove even æther's wildest gales the tuneful charm obey'd yes i beheld on earth angelic grace and charms divine which mortals rarely see such as both glad and pain the memory vain light unreal is all else i trace tears i saw shower'd from those fine eyes apace of which the sun ofttimes might envious be accents i heard sigh'd forth so movingly as to stay floods or mountains to displace love and good sense firmness with pity join'd and wailful grief a sweeter concert made than ever yet was pour'd on human ear and heaven unto the music so inclined that not a leaf was seen to stir the shade such melody had fraught the winds the atmosphere that everpainful everhonour'd day so left her living image on my heart beyond or lover's wit or poet's art that oft to it will doting memory stray a gentle pity softening her bright mien her sorrow there so sweet and sad was heard doubt in the gazer's bosom almost stirr'd goddess or mortal which made heaven serene fine gold her hair her face as sunlit snow her brows and lashes jet twin stars her eyne whence the young archer oft took fatal aim each loving lipwhence utterance sweet and low her pent grief founda rose which rare pearls line her tears of crystal and her sighs of flame that everhonour'd yet too bitter day her image hath so graven in my breast that only memory can return it dress'd in living charms no genius could portray her air such graceful sadness did display her plaintive soft laments my ear so bless'd i ask'd if mortal or a heavenly guest did thus the threatening clouds in smiles array her locks were gold her cheeks were breathing snow her brows with ebon arch'dbright stars her eyes wherein love nestled thence his dart to aim her teeth were pearlsthe rose's softest glow dwelt on that mouth whence woke to speech grief's sighs her tears were crystaland her breath was flame where'er i rest or turn my weary eyes to ease the longings which allure them still love pictures my bright lady at his will that ever my desire may verdant rise deep pity she with graceful grief applies warm feelings ever gentle bosoms fill while captived equally my fond ears thrill with her sweet accents and seraphic sighs love and fair truth were both allied to tell the charms i saw were in the world alone that 'neath the stars their like was never known nor ever words so dear and tender fell on listening ear nor tears so pure and bright from such fine eyes e'er sparkled in the light say from what part of heaven 'twas nature drew from what idea that so perfect mould to form such features bidding us behold in charms below what she above could do what fountainnymph what dryadmaid e'er threw upon the wind such tresses of pure gold what heart such numerous virtues can unfold although the chiefest all my fond hopes slew he for celestial charms may look in vain who has not seen my fair one's radiant eyes and felt their glances pleasingly beguile how love can heal his wounds then wound again he only knows who knows how sweet her sighs how sweet her converse and how sweet her smile in what celestial spherewhat realm of thought dwelt the bright model from which nature drew that fair and beauteous face in which we view her utmost power on earth divinely wrought what sylvan queenwhat nymph by fountain sought upon the breeze such golden tresses threw when did such virtues one sole breast imbue though with my death her chief perfection's fraught for heavenly beauty he in vain inquires who ne'er beheld her eyes' celestial stain where'er she turns around their brilliant fires he knows not how love wounds and heals again who knows not how she sweetly smiles respires the sweetest sighs and speaks in sweetest strain as one who sees a thing incredible in mutual marvel love and i combine confessing when she speaks or smiles divine none but herself can be her parallel where the fine arches of that fair brow swell so sparkle forth those twin true stars of mine than whom no safer brighter beacons shine his course to guide who'd wisely love and well what miracle is this when as a flower she sits on the rich grass or to her breast snowwhite and soft some fresh green shrub is press'd and oh how sweet in some fair april hour to see her pass alone in pure thought there weaving fresh garlands in her own bright hair o scatter'd steps o vague and busy thoughts o firmset memory o fierce desire o passion powerful o failing heart o eyes of mine not eyes but fountains now o leaf which honourest illustrious brows sole sign of double valour and best crown o painful life o error oft and sweet that make me search the lone plains and hard hills o beauteous face where love together placed the spurs and curb to strive with which is vain they prick and turn me so at his sole will o gentle amorous souls if such there be and you o naked spirits of mere dust tarry and see how great my suffering is gay joyous blooms and herbage glad with showers o'er which my pensive fair is wont to stray thou plain that listest her melodious lay as her fair feet imprint thy waste of flowers ye shrubs so trim ye green unfolding bowers ye violets clad in amorous pale array thou shadowy grove gilded by beauty's ray whose top made proud majestically towers o pleasant country o translucent stream bathing her lovely face her eyes so clear and catching of their living light the beam i envy ye her actions chaste and dear no rock shall stud thy waters but shall learn henceforth with passion strong as mine to burn o bright and happy flowers and herbage blest on which my lady treadso favour'd plain that hears her accents sweet and can retain the traces by her fairy steps impress'd pure shrubs with tender verdure newly dress'd pale amorous violetsleafy woods whose reign thy sun's bright rays transpierce and thus sustain your lofty stature and umbrageous crest o thou fair country and thou crystal stream which bathes her countenance and sparkling eyes stealing fresh lustre from their living beam how do i envy thee these precious ties thy rocky shores will soon be taught to gleam with the same flame that burns in all my sighs love thou who seest each secret thought display'd and the sad steps i take with thee sole guide this throbbing breast to thee thrown open wide to others' prying barr'd thine eyes pervade thou know'st what efforts following thee i made while still from height to height thy pinions glide nor deign'st one pitying look to turn aside on him who fainting treads a trackless glade i mark from far the mildlybeaming ray to which thou goad'st me through the devious maze alas i want thy wings to speed my way henceforth a distant homager i'll gaze content by silent longings to decay so that my sighs for her in her no anger raise o love that seest my heart without disguise and those hard toils from thee which i sustain look to my inmost thought behold the pain to thee unveil'd hid from all other eyes thou know'st for thee this breast what suffering tries me still from day to day o'er hill and plain thou chasest heedless still while i complain as to my wearied steps new thorns arise true i discern far off the cheering light to which through trackless wilds thou urgest me but wings like thine to bear me to delight i wantyet from these pangs i would not flee finding this only favour in her sight that not displeased my love and death she see o'er earth and sky her lone watch silence keeps and bird and beast in stirless slumber lie her starry chariot night conducts on high and in its bed the waveless ocean sleeps i wake muse burn and weep of all my pain the one sweet cause appears before me still war is my lot which grief and anger fill and thinking but of her some rest i gain thus from one bright and living fountain flows the bitter and the sweet on which i feed one hand alone can harm me or can heal and thus my martyrdom no limit knows a thousand deaths and lives each day i feel so distant are the paths to peace which lead 'tis now the hour when midnight silence reigns o'er earth and sea and whispering zephyr dies within his rocky cell and morpheus chains each beast that roams the wood and bird that wings the skies more blest those rangers of the earth and air whom night awhile relieves from toil and pain condemn'd to tears and sighs and wasting care to me the circling sun descends in vain ah me that mingling miseries and joys too near allied from one sad fountain flow the magic hand that comforts and annoys can hope and fell despair and life and death bestow too great the bliss to find in death relief fate has not yet fill'd up the measure of my grief as o'er the fresh grass her fair form its sweet and graceful passage makes at evening hours seems as around the newlywakening flowers found virtue issue from her delicate feet love which in true hearts only has his seat nor elsewhere deigns to prove his certain powers so warm a pleasure from her bright eyes showers no other bliss i ask no better meat and with her soft look and light step agree her mild and modest never eager air and sweetest words in constant union rare from these four sparksnor only these we see springs the great fire wherein i live and burn which makes me from the sun as nightbirds turn still had i sojourn'd in that delphic cave where young apollo prophet first became verona mantua were not sole in fame but florence too her poet now might have but since the waters of that spring no more enrich my land needs must that i pursue some other planet and with sickle new reap from my field of sticks and thorns its store dried is the olive elsewhere turn'd the stream whose source from famed parnassus was derived whereby of yore it throve in best esteem me fortune thus or fault perchance deprived of all good fruitunless eternal jove shower on my head some favour from above if love her beauteous eyes to earth incline and all her soul concentring in a sigh then breathe it in her voice of melody floating clear soft angelical divine my heart forthstolen so gently i resign and all my hopes and wishes changed i cry oh may my last breath pass thus blissfully if heaven so sweet a death for me design but the rapt sense by such enchantment bound and the strong will thus listening to possess heaven's joys on earth my spirit's flight delay and thus i live and thus drawn out and wound is my life's thread in dreamy blessedness by this sole syren from the realms of day her bright and lovelit eyes on earth she bends concentres her rich breath in one full sigh a brief pausea fond hushher voice on high clear soft angelical divine ascends such rapine sweet through all my heart extends new thoughts and wishes so within me vie perforce i saythus be it mine to die if heaven to me so fair a doom intends but ah those sounds whose sweetness laps my sense the strong desire of more that in me yearns restrain my spirit in its parting hence thus at her will i live thus winds and turns the yarn of life which to my lot is given earth's single siren sent to us from heaven love to my mind recalling that sweet thought the ancient confidant our lives between well comforts me and says i ne'er have been so near as now to what i hoped and sought i who at times with dangerous falsehood fraught at times with partial truth his words have seen live in suspense still missing the just mean 'twixt yea and nay a constant battle fought meanwhile the years pass on and i behold in my true glass the adverse time draw near her promise and my hope which limits here so let it be alone i grow not old changes not e'en with age my loving troth my fear is thisthe short life left us both such vain thought as wonted to mislead me in desert hope by wellassurèd moan makes me from company to live alone in following her whom reason bids me flee she fleeth as fast by gentle cruelty and after her my heart would fain be gone but armèd sighs my way do stop anon 'twixt hope and dread locking my liberty yet as i guess under disdainful brow one beam of ruth is in her cloudy look which comforteth the mind that erst for fear shook and therewithal bolded i seek the way how to utter the smart i suffer within but such it is i not how to begin full of a tender thought which severs me from all my kind a lonely musing thing from my breast's solitude i sometimes spring still seeking her whom most i ought to flee and see her pass though soft so adverse she that my soul spreads for flight a trembling wing of armèd sighs such legions does she bring the fair antagonist of love and me yet from beneath that dark disdainful brow or much i err one beam of pity flows soothing with partial warmth my heart's distress again my bosom feels its wonted glow but when my simple hope i would disclose my o'erfraught faltering tongue the crowded thoughts oppress oft as her angel face compassion wore with tears whose eloquence scarce fails to move with bland and courteous speech i boldly strove to soothe my foe and in meek guise implore but soon her eyes inspire vain hopes no more for all my fortune all my fate in love my life my death the good the ills i prove to her are trusted by one sovereign power hence 'tis whene'er my lips would silence break scarce can i hear the accents which i vent by passion render'd spiritless and weak ah now i find that fondness to excess fetters the tongue and overpowers intent faint is the flame that language can express oft have i meant my passion to declare when fancy read compliance in her eyes and oft with courteous speech with lovelorn sighs have wish'd to soften my obdurate fair but let that face one look of anger wear the intention fades for all that fate supplies or good or ill all all that i can prize my life my death love trusts to her dear care e'en i can scarcely hear my amorous moan so much my voice by passion is confined so faint so timid are my accents grown ah now the force of love i plainly see what can the tongue or what the impassion'd mind he that could speak his love ne'er loved like me me love has left in fair cold arms to lie which kill me wrongfully if i complain my martyrdom is doubled worse my pain better in silence love and loving die for she the frozen rhine with burning eye can melt at will the hard rock break in twain so equal to her beauty her disdain that others' pleasure wakes her angry sigh a breathing moving marble all the rest of very adamant is made her heart so hard to move it baffles all my art despite her lowering brow and haughty breast one thing she cannot my fond heart deter from tender hopes and passionate sighs for her o deadly envy virtue's constant foe with good and lovely eager to contest stealthily by what way in that fair breast hast entrance found by what arts changed it so thence by the roots my weal hast thou uptorn too blest in love hast shown me to that fair who welcomed once my chaste and humble prayer but seems to treat me now with hate and scorn but though you may by acts severe and ill sigh at my good and smile at my distress you cannot change for me a single thought not though a thousand times each day she kill can i or hope in her or love her less for though she scare love confidence has taught marking of those bright eyes the sun serene where reigneth love who mine obscures and grieves my hopeless heart the weary spirit leaves once more to gain its paradise terrene then finding full of bittersweet the scene and in the world how vast the web it weaves a secret sigh for baffled love it heaves whose spurs so sharp whose curb so hard have been by these two contrary and mix'd extremes with frozen or with fiery wishes fraught to stand 'tween misery and bliss she seems seldom in glad and oft in gloomy thought but mostly contrite for its bold emprize for of like seed like fruit must ever rise illomen'd was that star's malignant gleam that ruled my hapless birth and dim the morn that darted on my infant eyes the beam and harsh the wail that told a man was born and hard the sterile earth which first was worn beneath my infant feet but harder far and harsher still the tyrant maid whose scorn in league with savage love inflamed the war of all my passionslove himself more tame with pity soothes my ills while that cold heart insensible to the devouring flame which wastes my vitals triumphs in my smart one thought is comfortthat her scorn to bear excels e'er prosperous love with other earthly fair an evil star usher'd my natal morn if heaven have o'er us power as some have said hard was the cradle where i lay when born and hard the earth where first my young feet play'd cruel the lady who with eyes of scorn and fatal bow whose mark i still was made dealt me the wound o love which since i mourn whose cure thou only with those arms canst aid but ah to thee my torments pleasure bring she too severer would have wished the blow a spearhead thrust and not an arrowsting one comfort restsbetter to suffer so for her than others to enjoy and i sworn on thy golden dart on this for death rely the time and scene where i a slave became when i remember and the knot so dear which love's own hand so firmly fasten'd here which made my bitter sweet my grief a game my heart with fuel stored is as a flame of those soft sighs familiar to mine ear so lit within its very sufferings cheer on these i live and other aid disclaim that sun alone which beameth for my sight with his strong rays my ruin'd bosom burns now in the eve of life as in its prime and from afar so gives me warmth and light fresh and entire at every hour returns on memory the knot the scene the time through woods inhospitable wild i rove where armèd travellers bend their fearful way nor danger dread save from that sun of love bright sun which darts a soulenflaming ray of her i sing allthoughtless as i stray whose sweet idea strong as heaven's shall prove and oft methinks these pines these beeches move like nymphs 'mid which fond fancy sees her play i seem to hear her when the whispering gale steals through some thickwove branch when sings a bird when purls the stream along yon verdant vale how grateful might this darksome wood appear where horror reigns where scarce a sound is heard but ah 'tis far from all my heart holds dear amid the wild wood's lone and difficult ways where travel at great risk e'en men in arms i pass securefor only me alarms that sun which darts of living love the rays singing fond thoughts in simple lays to her whom time and space so little hide from me e'en here her form nor hers alone i see but maids and matrons in each beech and fir methinks i hear her when the bird's soft moan the sighing leaves i hear or through the dell where its bright lapse some murmuring rill pursues rarely of shadowing wood the silence lone the solitary horror pleased so well except that of my sun too much i lose love who his votary wings in heart and feet to the third heaven that lightly he may soar in one short day has many a stream and shore given to me in famed ardennes to meet unarm'd and single to have pass'd is sweet where war in earnest strikes nor tells before a helmless sailless ship 'mid ocean's roar my breast with dark and fearful thoughts replete but reach'd my dangerous journey's far extreme remembering whence i came and with whose wings from too great courage conscious terror springs but this fair country and belovèd stream with smiling welcome reassures my heart where dwells its sole light ready to depart love in one instant spurs me and restrains assures and frightens freezes me and burns smiles now and scowls now summons me and spurns in hope now holds me plunges now in pains now high now low my weary heart he hurls until fond passion loses quite the path and highest pleasure seems to stir but wrath my harass'd mind on such strange errors feeds a friendly thought there points the proper track not of such grief as from the full eye breaks to go where soon it hopes to be at ease but as if greater power thence turn'd it back despite itself another way it takes and to its own slow death and mine agrees when my sweet foe so haughty oft and high moved my brief ire no more my sight can thole one comfort is vouchsafed me lest i die through whose sole strength survives my harass'd soul where'er her eyesall light which would deny to my sad lifein scorn or anger roll mine with such true humility reply soon their meek glances all her rage control were it not so methinks i less could brook to gaze on hers than on medusa's mien which turn'd to marble all who met her look my friend act thus with thine for closed i ween all other aid and nothing flight avails against the wings on which our master sails thou po to distant realms this frame mayst bear on thy allpowerful thy impetuous tide but the free spirit that within doth bide nor for thy might nor any might doth care not varying here its course nor shifting there upon the favouring gale it joys to glide plying its wings toward the laurel's pride in spite of sails or oars of sea or air monarch of floods magnificent and strong that meet'st the sun as he leads on the day but in the west dost quit a fairer light thy curvèd course this body wafts along my spirit on love's pinions speeds its way and to its darling home directs its flight po thou upon thy strong and rapid tide this frame corporeal mayst onward bear but a free spirit is concealèd there which nor thy power nor any power can guide that spirit light on breeze auspicious buoy'd with course unvarying backward cleaves the air nor wave nor wind nor sail nor oar its care and plies its wings and seeks the laurel's pride 'tis thine proud king of rivers eastward borne to meet the sun as he leads on the day and from a brighter west 'tis thine to turn thy hornèd flood these passive limbs obey but uncontrollèd to its sweet sojourn on love's untiring plumes my spirit speeds its way love 'mid the grass beneath a laurel green the plant divine which long my flame has fed whose shade for me less bright than sad is seen a cunning net of gold and pearls had spread its bait the seed he sows and reaps i ween bitter and sweet which i desire yet dread gentle and soft his call as ne'er has been since first on adam's eyes the day was shed and the bright light which disenthrones the sun was flashing round and in her hand more fair than snow or ivory was the master rope so fell i in the snare their slave so won her speech angelical and winning air pleasure and fond desire and sanguine hope 'tis love's caprice to freeze the bosom now with bolts of ice with shafts of flame now burn and which his lighter pang i scarce discern or hope or fear or whelming fire or snow in heat i shiver and in cold i glow now thrill'd with love with jealousy now torn as if her thin robe by a rival worn or veil had screen'd him from my vengeful blow but more 'tis mine to burn by night by day and how i love the death by which i die nor thought can grasp nor tongue of bard can sing not so my freezing fireimpartially she shines to all and who would speed his way to that high beam in vain expands his fluttering wing love with hot zeal now burns the heart within now holds it fetter'd with a frozen fear leaving it doubtful to our judgment here if hope or dread if flame or frost shall win in june i shiver burn december in full of desires from jealousy ne'er clear e'en as a lady who her loving fee hides 'neath a little veil of texture thin of the two ills the first is all mine own by day by night to burn how sweet that pain dwells not in thought nor ever poet sings not so the other my fair flame is shown she levels all who hopes the crest to gain of that proud light expands in vain his wings if thus the dear glance of my lady slay on her sweet sprightly speech if dangers wait if o'er me love usurp a power so great oft as she speaks or when her sunsmiles play alas what were it if she put away or for my fault or by my luckless fate her eyes from pity and to death's full hate which now she keeps aloof should then betray thus if at heart with terror i am cold when o'er her fair face doubtful shadows spring the feeling has its source in sufferings old woman by nature is a fickle thing and female heartstime makes the proverb sure can never long one state of love endure if the soft glance the speech both kind and wise of that beloved one can wound me so and if whene'er she lets her accents flow or even smiles love gains such victories alas what should i do were those dear eyes which now secure my life through weal and woe from fault of mine or evil fortune slow to shed on me their light in pity's guise and if my trembling spirit groweth cold whene'er i see change to her aspect spring this fear is only born of trials old woman by nature is a fickle thing and hence i know her heart hath power to hold but a brief space love's sweet imagining love nature laura's gentle self combines she where each lofty virtue dwells and reigns against my peace to pierce with mortal pains love toilssuch ever are his stern designs nature by bonds so slight to earth confines her slender form a breath may break its chains and she so much her heart the world disdains longer to tread life's wearying round repines hence still in her sweet frame we view decay all that to earth can joy and radiance lend or serve as mirror to this laggard age and death's dread purpose should not pity stay too well i see where all those hopes must end with which i fondly soothed my lingering pilgrimage love nature and that gentle soul as bright where every lofty virtue dwells and reigns are sworn against my peace as wont love strains his every power that i may perish quite nature her delicate form by bonds so slight holds in existence that no help sustains she is so modest that she now disdains longer to brook this vile life's painful fight thus fades and fails the spirit day by day which on those dear and lovely limbs should wait our mirror of true grace which wont to give and soon if mercy turn not death away alas too well i see in what sad state are those vain hopes wherein i loved to live this wondrous phoenix with the golden plumes forms without art so rare a ring to deck that beautiful and soft and snowy neck that every heart it melts and mine consumes forms too a natural diadem which lights the air around whence love with silent steel draws liquid subtle fire which still i feel fierce burning me though sharpest winter bites border'd with azure a rich purple vest sprinkled with roses veils her shoulders fair rare garment hers as grace unique alone fame in the opulent and odorous breast of arab mountains buries her sole lair who in our heaven so high a pitch has flown had tuneful maro seen and homer old the living sun which here mine eyes behold the best powers they had join'd of either lyre sweetness and strength that fame she might acquire unsung had been with vex'd Æneas then achilles and ulysses godlike men and for nigh sixty years who ruled so well the world and who before Ægysthus fell nay that old flower of virtues and of arms as this new flower of chastity and charms a rival star had scarce such radiance flung in rugged verse him honour'd ennius sung i her in mine grant heaven on my poor lays she frown not nor disdain my humble praise the son of philip when he saw the tomb of fierce achilles with a sigh thus said o happy whose achievements erst found room from that illustrious trumpet to be spread o'er earth for everbut beyond the gloom of deep oblivion shall that loveliest maid whose like to view seems not of earthly doom by my imperfect accents be convey'd her of the homeric the orphèan lyre most worthy or that shepherd mantua's pride to be the theme of their immortal lays her stars and unpropitious fate denied this palmand me bade to such height aspire who haply dim her glories by my praise when alexander at the famous tomb of fierce achilles stood the ambitious sigh burst from his bosomfortunate on whom th' eternal bard shower'd honours bright and high but ah for so to each is fix'd his doom this pure fair dove whose like by mortal eye was never seen what poor and scanty room for her great praise can my weak verse supply whom worthiest homer's line and orpheus' song or his whom reverent mantua still admires sole and sufficient she to wake such lyres an adverse star a fate here only wrong entrusts to one who worships her dear name yet haply injures by his praise her fame o blessed sun that sole sweet leaf i love first loved by thee in its fair seat alone bloometh without a peer since from above to adam first our shining ill was shown pause we to look on her although to stay thy course i pray thee yet thy beams retire their shades the mountains fling and parting day parts me from all i most on earth desire the shadows from yon gentle heights that fall where sparkles my sweet fire where brightly grew that stately laurel from a sucker small increasing as i speak hide from my view the beauteous landscape and the blessèd scene where dwells my true heart with its only queen my bark deep laden with oblivion rides o'er boisterous waves through winter's midnight gloom 'twixt scylla and charybdis while in room of pilot love mine enemy presides at every oar a guilty fancy bides holding at nought the tempest and the tomb a moist eternal wind the sails consume of sighs of hopes and of desire besides a shower of tears a fog of chill disdain bathes and relaxes the o'erwearied cords with error and with ignorance entwined my two loved lights their wonted aid restrain reason or art stormquell'd no help affords nor hope remains the wish'dfor port to find my lethefreighted bark with reckless prore cleaves the rough sea 'neath wintry midnight skies my old foe at the helm our compass eyes with scylla and charybdis on each shore a prompt and daring thought at every oar which equally the storm and death defies while a perpetual humid wind of sighs of hopes and of desires its light sail tore bathe and relax its worn and weary shrouds which ignorance with error intertwines torrents of tears of scorn and anger clouds hidden the twin dear lights which were my signs reason and art amid the waves lie dead and hope of gaining port is almost fled beneath a laurel two fair streams between at early sunrise of the opening year a milkwhite fawn upon the meadow green of gold its either horn i saw appear so mild yet so majestic was its mien i left to follow all my labours here as miners after treasure in the keen desire of new forget the old to fear let none impedeso round its fair neck run the words in diamond and topaz writ my lord to give me liberty sees fit and now the sun his noontide height had won when i with weary though unsated view fell in the streamand so my vision flew a form i saw with secret awe nor ken i what it warns pure as the snow a gentle doe it seem'd with silver horns erect she stood close by a wood between two running streams and brightly shone the morning sun upon that land of dreams the pictured hind fancy design'd glowing with love and hope graceful she stepp'd but distant kept like the timid antelope playful yet coy with secret joy her image fill'd my soul and o'er the sense soft influence of sweet oblivion stole gold i beheld and emerald on the collar that she wore words toobut theirs were characters of legendary lore cæsar's decree hath made me free and through his solemn charge untouch'd by men o'er hill and glen i wander here at large the sun had now with radiant brow climb'd his meridian throne yet still mine eye untiringly gazed on that lovely one a voice was heardquick disappear'd my dreamthe spell was broken then came distress to the consciousness of life i had awoken as life eternal is with god to be no void left craving there of all possess'd so lady mine to be with you makes blest this brief frail span of mortal life to me so fair as now ne'er yet was mine to see if truth from eyes to heart be well express'd lovely and blessèd spirit of my breast which levels all high hopes and wishes free nor would i more demand if less of haste she show'd to part for if as legends tell and credence find are some who live by smell on water some or fire who touch and taste all things which neither strength nor sweetness give why should not i upon your dear sight live here stand we love our glory to behold how passing nature lovely high and rare behold what showers of sweetness falling there what floods of light by heaven to earth unroll'd how shine her robes in purple pearls and gold so richly wrought with skill beyond compare how glance her feether beaming eyes how fair through the dark cloister which these hills enfold the verdant turf and flowers of thousand hues beneath yon oak's old canopy of state spring round her feet to pay their amorous duty the heavens in joyful reverence cannot choose but light up all their fires to celebrate her praise whose presence charms their awful beauty here tarry love our glory to behold nought in creation so sublime we trace ah see what sweetness showers upon that face heaven's brightness to this earth those eyes unfold see with what magic art pearls purple gold that form transcendant unexampled grace beneath the shadowing hills observe her pace her glance replete with elegance untold the verdant turf and flowers of every hue clustering beneath yon aged holmoak's gloom for the sweet pressure of her fair feet sue the orbs of fire that stud yon beauteous sky cheer'd by her presence and her smiles assume superior lustre and serenity i feed my fancy on such noble food that jove i envy not his godlike meal i see herjoy invades me like a flood and lethe of all other bliss i feel i hear herinstantly that music rare bids from my captive heart the fond sigh flow borne by the hand of love i know not where a double pleasure in one draught i know even in heaven that dear voice pleaseth well so winning are its words its sound so sweet none can conceive save who had heard their spell thus in the same small space visibly meet all charms of eye and ear wherewith our race art genius nature heaven have join'd to grace such noble aliment sustains my soul that jove i envy not his godlike food i gaze on herand feel each other good engulph'd in that blest draught at lethe's bowl her every word i in my heart enrol that on its grief it still may constant brood prostrate by lovemy doom not understood from that one form i feel a twin control my spirit drinks the music of her voice whose speaking harmony to heaven so dear they only feel who in its tone partake again within her face my eyes rejoice for in its gentle lineaments appear what genius nature art and heaven can wake the gale that o'er yon hills flings softer blue and wakes to life each bud that gems the glade i know its breathings such impression made wafting me fame but wafting sorrow too my wearied soul to soothe i bid adieu to those dear tuscan haunts i first survey'd and to dispel the gloom around me spread i seek this day my cheering sun to view whose sweet attraction is so strong so great that love again compels me to its light then he so dazzles me that vain were flight not arms to brave 'tis wings to 'scape my fate i ask but by those beams i'm doom'd to die when distant which consume and which enflame when nigh the gentle air which brightens each green hill wakening the flowers that paint this bowery glade i recognise it by its soft breath still my sorrow and renown which long has made again where erst my sick heart shelter sought from my dear native tuscan air i flee that light may cheer my dark and troubled thought i seek my sun and hope today to see that sun so great and genial sweetness brings that love compels me to his beams again which then so dazzle me that flight is vain i ask for my escape not arms but wings heaven by this light condemns me sure to die which from afar consumes and burns when nigh i alter day by day in hair and mien yet shun not the old dangerous baits and dear nor sever from the laurel limed and green which nor the scorching sun nor fierce cold sear dry shall the sea the sky be starless seen ere i shall cease to covet and to fear her lovely shadow andwhich ill i screen to like yet loathe the deep wound cherish'd here for never hope i respite from my pain from bones and nerves and flesh till i am free unless mine enemy some pity deign till things impossible accomplish'd be none but herself or death the blow can heal which love from her bright eyes has left my heart to feel the gentle gale that plays my face around murmuring sweet mischief through the verdant grove to fond remembrance brings the time when love first gave his deep although delightful wound gave me to view that beauteous face ne'er found veil'd as disdain or jealousy might move to view her locks that shone bright gold above then loose but now with pearls and jewels bound those locks she sweetly scatter'd to the wind and then coil'd up again so gracefully that but to think on it still thrills the sense these time has in more sober braids confined and bound my heart with such a powerful tie that death alone can disengage it thence the balmy airs that from yon leafy spray my fever'd brow with playful murmurs greet recall to my fond heart the fatal day when love his first wound dealt so deep yet sweet and gave me the fair facein scorn away since turn'd or hid by jealousyto meet the locks which pearls and gems now oft array whose shining tints with finest gold compete so sweetly on the wind were then display'd or gather'd in with such a graceful art their very thought with passion thrills my mind time since has twined them in more sober braid and with a snare so powerful bound my heart death from its fetters only can unbind the heavenly airs from yon green laurel roll'd where love to phoebus whilom dealt his stroke where on my neck was placed so sweet a yoke that freedom thence i hope not to behold o'er me prevail as o'er that arab old medusa when she changed him to an oak nor ever can the fairy knot be broke whose light outshines the sun not merely gold i mean of those bright locks the curlèd snare which folds and fastens with so sweet a grace my soul whose humbleness defends alone her mere shade freezes with a cold despair my heart and tinges with pale fear my face and oh her eyes have power to make me stone the pleasant gale that to the sun unplaits and spreads the gold love's fingers weave and braid o'er her fine eyes and all around her head fetters my heart the wishful sigh creates no nerve but thrills no artery but beats approaching my fair arbiter with dread who in her doubtful scale hath ofttimes weigh'd whether or death or life on me awaits beholding too those eyes their fires display and on those shoulders shine such wreaths of hair whose witching tangles my poor heart ensnare but how this magic's wrought i cannot say for twofold radiance doth my reason blind and sweetness to excess palls and o'erpowers my mind the soft gale to the sun which shakes and spreads the gold which love's own hand has spun and wrought there with her bright eyes and those fairy threads binds my poor heart and sifts each idle thought my veins of blood my bones of marrow fail thrills all my frame when i to hear or gaze draw near to her who oft in balance frail my life and death together holds and weighs and see those lovefires shine wherein i burn and as its snow each sweetest shoulder heaves flash the fair tresses right and left by turn verse fails to paint what fancy scarce conceives from two such lights is intellect distress'd and by such sweetness weary and oppress'd o beauteous hand that dost my heart subdue and in a little space my life confine hand where their skill and utmost efforts join nature and heaven their plastic powers to show sweet fingers seeming pearls of orient hue to my wounds only cruel fingers fine love who towards me kindness doth design for once permits ye naked to our view thou glove most dear most elegant and white encasing ivory tinted with the rose more precious covering ne'er met mortal sight would i such portion of thy veil had gain'd o fleeting gifts which fortune's hand bestows 'tis justice to restore what theft alone obtain'd o beauteous hand which robb'st me of my heart and holdest all my life in little space hand which their utmost effort and best art nature and heaven alike have join'd to grace o sister pearls of orient hue ye fine and fairy fingers to my wounds alone cruel and cold does love awhile incline in my behalf that naked ye are shown o glove most snowy delicate and dear which spotless ivory and fresh roses set where can on earth a sweeter spoil be met unless her fair veil thus reward us here inconstancy of human things the theft late won and dearly prized too soon from me is reft not of one dear hand only i complain which hides it to my loss again from view but its fair fellow and her soft arms too are prompt my meek and passive heart to pain love spreads a thousand toils nor one in vain amid the many charms bright pure and new that so her high and heavenly part endue no style can equal it no mind attain that starry forehead and those tranquil eyes the fair angelic mouth where pearl and rose contrast each other whence rich music flows these fill the gazer with a fond surprise the fine head the bright tresses which defied the sun to match them in his noonday pride me love and fortune then supremely bless'd her glove which gold and silken broidery bore i seem'd to reach of utmost bliss the crest musing within myself on her who wore ne'er on that day i think of days the best which made me rich then beggar'd as before but rage and sorrow fill mine aching breast with slighted love and selfshame boiling o'er that on my precious prize in time of need i kept not hold nor made a firmer stand 'gainst what at best was merely angel force that my feet were not wings their flight to speed and so at last take vengeance on the hand make my poor eyes of tears the too oft source the flames that ever on my bosom prey from living ice or cold fair marble pour and so exhaust my veins and waste my core almost insensibly i melt away death his stern arm already rear'd to slay as thunders angry heaven or lions roar pursues my life that vainly flies before while i with terror shake and mute obey and yet were love and pity friends they might a double column for my succour throw between my worn soul and the mortal blow it may not be such feelings in the sight of my loved foe and mistress never stir the fault is in my fortune not in her alas with ardour past belief i glow none doubt this truth except one only fair who all excels for whom alone i care she plainly sees yet disbelieves my woe o rich in charms but poor in faith canst thou look in these eyes nor read my whole heart there were i not fated by my baleful star for me from pity's fount might favour flow my flame of which thou tak'st so little heed and thy high praises pour'd through all my song o'er many a breast may future influence spread these my sweet fair so warns prophetic thought closed thy bright eye and mute thy poet's tongue e'en after death shall still with sparks be fraught alas i burn yet credence fail to gain all others credit it save only she all others who excels alone for me she seems to doubt it still yet sees it plain infinite beauty little faith and slow perceive ye not my whole heart in mine eyes well might i hope save for my hostile skies from mercy's fount some pitying balm to flow yet this my flame which scarcely moves your care and your warm praises sung in these fond rhymes may thousands yet inflame in after times these i foresee in fancy my sweet fair though your bright eyes be closed and cold my breath shall lighten other loves and live in death soul with such various faculties endued to think write speak to read to see to hear my doting eyes and thou my faithful ear where drinks my heart her counsels wise and good your fortune smiles if after or before the path were won so badly follow'd yet ye had not then her bright eyes' lustre met nor traced her light feet earth's green carpet o'er now with so clear a light so sure a sign 'twere shame to err or halt on the brief way which makes thee worthy of a home divine that better course my weary will essay to pierce the cloud of her sweet scorn be thine pursuing her pure steps and heavenly ray sweet scorn sweet anger and sweet misery forgiveness sweet sweet burden and sweet ill sweet accents that mine ear so sweetly thrill that sweetly bland now sweetly fierce can be mourn not my soul but suffer silently and those embitter'd sweets thy cup that fill with the sweet honour blend of loving still her whom i told thou only pleasest me hereafter moved with envy some may say for that highboasted beauty of his day enough the bard has borne then heave a sigh others oh why most hostile fortune why could not these eyes that lovely form survey why was she early born or wherefore late was i sweet anger sweet disdain and peace as sweet sweet ill sweet pain sweet burthen that i bear sweet speech as sweetly heard sweet speech my fair that now enflames my soul now cools its heat patient my soul endure the wrongs you meet and all th' embitter'd sweets you're doomed to share blend with that sweetest bliss the maid to greet in these soft words thou only art my care haply some youth shall sighing envious say enough has borne the bard so fond so true for that bright beauty brightest of his day while others cry sad eyes how hard your fate why could i ne'er this matchless beauty view why was she born so soon or i so late perdie i said it not nor never thought to do as well as i ye wot i have no power thereto and if i did the lot that first did me enchain may never slake the knot but strait it to my pain and if i did each thing that may do harm or woe continually may wring my heart where so i go report may always ring of shame on me for aye if in my heart did spring the words that you do say and if i did each star that is in heaven above may frown on me to mar the hope i have in love and if i did such war as they brought unto troy bring all my life afar from all his lust and joy and if i did so say the beauty that me bound increase from day to day more cruel to my wound with all the moan that may to plaint may turn my song my life may soon decay without redress by wrong if i be clear from thought why do you then complain then is this thing but sought to turn my heart to pain then this that you have wrought you must it now redress of right therefore you ought such rigour to repress and as i have deserved so grant me now my hire you know i never swerved you never found me liar for rachel have i served for leah cared i never and her i have reserved within my heart for ever if i said so may i be hated by her on whose love i live without which i should die if i said so my days be sad and short may my false soul some vile dominion court if i said so may every star to me be hostile round me grow pale fear and jealousy and she my foe as cruel still and cold as fair she aye must be if i said so may love upon my heart expend his golden shafts on her the leaden dart be heaven and earth and god and man my foe and she still more severe if i said so if i said so may he whose blind lights lead me straightway to my grave trample yet worse his slave nor she behave gentle and kind to me in look or word or deed if i said so then through my brief life may all that is hateful block my worthless weary way if i said so may the proud frost in thee grow prouder as more fierce the fire in me if i said so no more then may the warm sun or bright moon be view'd nor maid nor matron's form but one dread storm such as proud pharaoh saw when israel he pursued if i said so despite each contrite sigh let courtesy for me and kindly feeling die if i said so that voice to anger swell which was so sweet when first her slave i fell if i said so i should offend whom i e'en from my earliest breath until my day of death would gladly take alone in cloister'd cell my single saint to make but if i said not so may she who first in life's green youth my heart to hope so sweetly nursed deign yet once more my weary bark to guide with native kindness o'er the troublous tide and graceful grateful as her wont before when for i could no more my all myself i gave to be her slave forget not the deep faith with which i still adore i did not could not never would say so for all that gold can give cities or courts bestow let truth then take her old proud seat on high and low on earth let baffled falsehood lie thou know'st me love if aught my state within belief or care may win tell her that i would call him blest o'er all who doom'd like me to pine dies ere his strife begin rachel i sought not leah to secure nor could i this vain life with other fair endure and should from earth heaven summon her again myself would gladly die for her or with her when elijah's fiery car her pure soul wafts on high as pass'd the years which i have left behind to pass my future years i fondly thought amid old studies with desires the same but from my lady since i fail to find the accustom'd aid the work himself has wrought let love regard my tempter who became yet scarce i feel the shame that at my age he makes me thus a thief of that bewitching light for which my life is steep'd in cureless grief in youth i better might have ta'en the part which now i needs must take for less dishonour boyish errors make those sweet eyes whence alone my life had health were ever of their high and heavenly charms so kind to me when first my thrall begun that as a man whom not his proper wealth but some extern yet secret succour arms i lived with them at ease offending none me now their glances shun as one injurious and importunate who poor and hungry did myself the very act in better state which i in others chid from mercy thus if envy bar me be my amorous thirst and helplessness my plea in divers ways how often have i tried if reft of these aught mortal could retain e'en for a single day in life my frame but ah my soul which has no rest beside speeds back to those angelic lights again and i though but of wax turn to their flame planting my mind's best aim where less the watch o'er what i love is sure as birds i' th' wild wood green where less they fear will sooner take the lure so on her lovely mien now one and now another look i turn wherewith at once i nourish me and burn strange sustenance upon my death i feed and live in flames a salamander rare and yet no marvel as from love it flows a blithe lamb 'mid the harass'd fleecy breed whilom i lay whom now to worst despair fortune and love as is their wont expose winter with cold and snows with violets and roses spring is rife and thus if i obtain some few poor aliments of else weak life who can of theft complain so rich a fair should be content with this though others live on hers if nought she miss who knows not what i am and still have been from the first day i saw those beauteous eyes which alter'd of my life the natural mood traverse all lands explore each sea between who can acquire all human qualities there some on odours live by ind's vast flood here light and fire are food my frail and famish'd spirit

pent flames are strongest and if left to swell not long by any means can rest unknown this own i love and at your hands was taught when i thus silent burn'd you knew it well now e'en to me my cries are weary grown annoy to far and near so long that wrought o false world o vain thought o my hard fate where now to follow thee ah from what meteor light sprung in my heart the constant hope which she who armour'd with your might drags me to death binds o'er it as a chain yours is the fault though mine the loss and pain thus bear i of true love the pains along asking forgiveness of another's debt and for mine own whose eyes should rather shun that too great light and to the siren's song my ears be closed though scarce can i regret that so sweet poison should my heart o'errun yet would that all were done that who the first wound gave my last would deal for if i right divine it were best mercy soon my fate to seal since not a chance is mine that he may treat me better than before 'tis well to die if death shut sorrow's door my song with fearless feet the field i keep for death in flight were shame myself i needs must blame for these laments tears sighs and death to meet such fate for her

enlighten hell and night and take souls from our bodies and their own to make a speech where genius high yet gentle shone evermore broken by the balmiest sighs such magic spells transform'd me in this wise life's three first stages train'd my soul in part to place its care on objects high and new and to disparage what men often prize but left alone and of her fatal course as yet uncertain frolicsome and free she enter'd at springtime a lovely wood a tender flower there was born in that wood the day before whose root was in a part high and impervious e'en to spirit free for many snares were there of forms so new and such desire impell'd my sanguine course that to lose freedom were to gain a prize dear sweet yet perilous and painful prize which quickly drew me to that verdant wood doom'd to mislead me midway in life's course the world i since have ransack'd part by part for rhymes or stones or sap of simples new which yet might give me back the spirit free but ah i feel my body must be free from that hard knot which is its richest prize ere medicine old or incantations new can heal the wounds which pierced me in that wood thorny and troublous where i play'd such part leaving it halt who enter'd with hot course yes full of snares and sticks a difficult course have i to run where easy foot and sure were rather needed healthy in each part thou lord who still of pity hast the prize stretch to me thy right hand in this wild wood and let thy sun dispel my darkness new look on my state amid temptations new which interrupting my life's tranquil course have made me denizen of darkling wood if good restore me fetterless and free my wand'ring consort and be thine the prize if yet with thee i find her in blest part lo thus in part i put my questions new if mine be any prize

happy spirit in a pensive air her planet nay heaven's king has fitly shrined all gifts and graces in this lady fair true honour purest praises worth refined above what rapt dreams of best poets are virtue and love so rich in her unite with natural beauty dignified address gestures that still a silent grace express and in her eyes i know not what strange light that makes the noonday dark the dusk night clear bitter the sweet and e'en sad absence dear though nobly born so humbly calm she dwells so bright her intellectso pure her mind the blossom and its bloom in her we find with pensive look her heart with mirth rebels thus by her planets' union she excels nayhis the stars' proud sov'reign who enshrined there honour worth and fortitude combined which to the bard inspired his hope dispels love blooms in her but 'tis his home most pure her daily virtues blend with native grace her noiseless movements speak though she is mute such power her eyes they can the day obscure illume the nightthe honey's sweetness chase and wake its stream where gall doth oft pollute through the long lingering day estranged from rest my sorrows flow unceasing doubly flow painful prerogative of lover's woe in that still hour when slumber soothes th' unblest with such deep anguish is my heart opprest so stream mine eyes with tears of things below most miserable i for cupid's bow has banish'd quiet from this heaving breast ah me while thus in suffering morn to morn and eve to eve succeeds of death i view so should this life be named onehalf gone by yet this i weep not but another's scorn that she my friend so tender and so true should see me hopeless burn and yet her aid deny erewhile i labour'd with complaint so true and in such fervid rhymes to make me heard seem'd as at last some spark of pity stirr'd in the hard heart which frost in summer knew th' unfriendly cloud whose cold veil o'er it grew broke at the first breath of mine ardent word or low'ring still she others' blame incurr'd her bright and killing eyes who thus withdrew no ruth for self i crave for her no hate i wish not this_that_ passes power of mine such was mine evil star and cruel fate but i shall ever sing her charms divine that when i have resign'd this mortal breath the world may know how sweet to me was death where'er she moves whatever dames among beauteous or graceful matchless she below with her fair face she makes all others show dim as the day's bright orb night's starry throng and love still whispers with prophetic tongue long as on earth is seen that glittering brow shall life have charms but she shall cease to glow and with her all my power shall fleet along should nature from the skies their twinlights wrest hush every breeze each herb and flower destroy strip man of reasonspeech from ocean's breast his tides his tenants chasesuch earth's annoy yea still more darken'd were it and unblest had she thy laura closed her eyes to love and joy whene'er amidst the damsels blooming bright she shows herself whose like was never made at her approach all other beauties fade as at morn's orient glow the gems of night love seems to whisperwhile to mortal sight her graces shall on earth be yet display'd life shall be blest 'till soon with her decay'd the virtues and my reign shall sink outright of moon and sun should nature rob the sky the air of winds the earth of herbs and leaves mankind of speech and intellectual eye the ocean's bed of fish and dancing waves even so shall all things dark and lonely lye when of her beauty death the world bereaves the birds' sweet wail their renovated song at break of morn make all the vales resound with lapse of crystal waters pouring round in clear swift runnels the fresh shores among she whose pure passion knows nor guile nor wrong with front of snow with golden tresses crown'd combing her aged husband's hoar locks found wakes me when sportful wakes the warbling throng thus roused from sleep i greet the dawning day and its succeeding sun with one more bright still dazzling as in early youth my sight both suns i've seen at once uplift their ray this drives the radiance of the stars away but that which gilds my life eclipses e'en his light soon as gay morn ascends her purple car the plaintive warblings of the newwaked grove the murmuring streams through flowery meads that rove fill with sweet melody the valleys fair aurora famed for constancy in love whose face with snow whose locks with gold compare smoothing her aged husband's silvery hair bids me the joys of rural music prove then waking i salute the sun of day but chief that beauteous sun whose cheering ray once gilt nay gilds e'en now life's scene so bright dear suns which oft i've seen together rise this dims each meaner lustre of the skies and that sweet sun i love dims every light whence could love take the gold and from what vein to form those bright twin locks what thorn could grow those roses and what mead that white bestow of the fresh dews which pulse and breath obtain whence came those pearls that modestly restrain accents which courteous sweet and rare can flow and whence those charms that so divinely show spread o'er a face serene as heaven's blue plain taught by what angel or what tuneful sphere was that celestial song which doth dispense such potent magic to the ravish'd ear what sun illumed those bright commanding eyes which now look peaceful now in hostile guise now torture me with hope and now with fear say from what vein did love procure the gold to make those sunny tresses from what thorn stole he the rose and whence the dew of morn bidding them breathe and live in beauty's mould what depth of ocean gave the pearls that told those gentle accents sweet though rarely born whence came so many graces to adorn that brow more fair than summer skies unfold oh say what angels lead what spheres control the song divine which wastes my life away who can with trifles now my senses move what sun gave birth unto the lofty soul of those enchanting eyes whose glances stray to burn and freeze my heartthe sport of love what destiny of mine what fraud or force unarm'd again conducts me to the field where never came i but with shame to yield 'scape i or fall which better is or worse not worse but better from so sweet a source shine in my heart those lights so bright reveal'd the fatal fire e'en now as then which seal'd my doom though twenty years have roll'd their course i feel death's messengers when those dear eyes dazzling me from afar i see appear and if on me they turn as she draw near love with such sweetness tempts me then and tries tell it i cannot nor recall in sooth for wit and language fail to reach the truth _p_ pensive and glad accompanied alone ladies who cheat the time with converse gay where does my life where does my death delay why not with you her form as usual shown _l_ glad are we her rare lustre to have known and sad from her dear company to stay which jealousy and envy keep away o'er other's bliss as their own ill who moan _p_ who lovers can restrain or give them law _l_ no one the soul harshness and rage the frame as erst in us this now in her appears as oft the face betrays the heart we saw clouds that obscuring her high beauty came and in her eyes the dewy trace of tears when in the sea sinks the sun's golden light and on my mind and nature darkness lies with the pale moon faint stars and clouded skies i pass a weary and a painful night to her who hears me not i then rehearse my sad life's fruitless toils early and late and with the world and with my gloomy fate with love with laura and myself converse sleep is forbid me i have no repose but sighs and groans instead till morn returns and tears with which mine eyes a sad heart feeds then comes the dawn the thick air clearer grows but not my soul the sun which in it burns alone can cure the grief his fierce warmth breeds when phoebus lashes to the western main his fiery steeds and shades the lurid air grief shades my soul my night is spent in care yon moon yon stars yon heaven begin my pain wretch that i am full oft i urge in vain to heedless beings all those pangs i bear of the false world of an unpitying fair of love and fickle fortune i complain from eve's last glance till morning's earliest ray sleep shuns my couch rest quits my tearful eye and my rack'd breast heaves many a plaintive sigh then bright aurora cheers the rising day but cheers not mefor to my sorrowing heart one sun alone can cheering light impart if faith most true a heart that cannot feign if love's sweet languishment and chasten'd thought and wishes pure by nobler feelings taught if in a labyrinth wanderings long and vain if on the brow each pang pourtray'd to bear or from the heart low broken sounds to draw withheld by shame or check'd by pious awe if on the faded cheek love's hue to wear if than myself to hold one far more dear if sighs that cease not tears that ever flow wrung from the heart by all love's various woe in absence if consumed and chill'd when near if these be ills in which i waste my prime though i the sufferer be yours lady is the crime if fondest faith a heart to guile unknown by melting languors the soft wish betray'd if chaste desires with temper'd warmth display'd if weary wanderings comfortless and lone if every thought in every feature shown or in faint tones and broken sounds convey'd as fear or shame my pallid cheek array'd in violet hues with love's thick blushes strown if more than self another to hold dear if still to weep and heave incessant sighs to feed on passion or in grief to pine to glow when distant and to freeze when near if hence my bosom's anguish takes its rise thine lady is the crime the punishment is mine twelve ladies their rare toil who lightly bore rather twelve stars encircling a bright sun i saw gayseated a small bark upon whose like the waters never cleaved before not such took jason to the fleece of yore whose fatal gold has ev'ry heart now won nor such the shepherd boy's by whom undone troy mourns whose fame has pass'd the wide world o'er i saw them next on a triumphal car where known by her chaste cherub ways aside my laura sate and to them sweetly sung things not of earth to man such visions are blest tiphys blest automedon to guide the bark or car of band so bright and young never was bird spoil'd of its young more sad or wild beast in his lair more lone than me now that no more that lovely face i see the only sun my fond eyes ever had in ceaseless sorrow is my chief delight my food to poison turns to grief my joy the night is torture dark the clearest sky and my lone pillow a hard field of fight sleep is indeed as has been well express'd akin to death for it the heart removes from the dear thought in which alone i live land above all with plenty beauty bless'd ye flowery plains green banks and shady groves ye hold the treasure for whose loss i grieve ye laughing gales that sporting with my fair the silky tangles of her locks unbraid and down her breast their golden treasures spread then in fresh mazes weave her curling hair you kiss those bright destructive eyes that bear the flaming darts by which my heart has bled my trembling heart that oft has fondly stray'd to seek the nymph whose eyes such terrors wear methinks she's foundbut oh 'tis fancy's cheat methinks she's seenbut oh 'tis love's deceit methinks she's nearbut truth cries 'tis not so go happy gale and with my laura dwell go happy stream and to my laura tell what envied joys in thy clear crystal flow thou gale that movest and disportest round those bright crisp'd locks by them moved sweetly too that all their fine gold scatter'st to the view then coil'st them up in beauteous braids fresh wound about those eyes thou playest where abound the am'rous swarms whose stings my tears renew and i my treasure tremblingly pursue like some scared thing that stumbles o'er the ground methinks i find her now and now perceive she's distant now i soar and now descend now what i wish now what is true believe stay and enjoy blest air the living beam and thou o rapid and translucent stream why can't i change my course and thine attend my poor heart op'ning with his puissant hand love planted there as in its home to dwell a laurel green and bright whose hues might well in rivalry with proudest emeralds stand plough'd by my pen and by my heartsighs fann'd cool'd by the soft rain from mine eyes that fell it grew in grace upbreathing a sweet smell unparallel'd in any age or land fair fame bright honour virtue firm rare grace the chastest beauty in celestial frame these be the roots whence birth so noble came such ever in my mind her form i trace a happy burden and a holy thing to which on rev'rent knee with loving prayer i cling i sang who now lament nor less delight than in my song i found in tears i find for on the cause and not effect inclined my senses still desire to scale that height whence mildly if she smile or hardly smite cruel and cold her acts or meek and kind all i endure nor care what weights they bind e'en though her rage would break my armour quite let love and laura world and fortune join and still pursue their usual course for me i care not if unblest in life to be let me or burn to death or living pine no gentler state than mine beneath the sun since from a source so sweet my bitters run i wept but now i sing its heavenly light that living sun conceals not from my view but virtuous love therein revealeth true his holy purposes and precious might whence as his wont such flood of sorrow springs to shorten of my life the friendless course nor bridge nor ford nor oar nor sails have force to forward mine escape nor even wings but so profound and of so full a vein my suff'ring is so far its shore appears scarcely to reach it can e'en thought contrive nor palm nor laurel pity prompts to gain but tranquil olive and the dark sky clears and checks my grief and wills me to survive i lived so tranquil with my lot content no sorrow visited nor envy pined to other loves if fortune were more kind one pang of mine their thousand joys outwent but those bright eyes whence never i repent the pains i feel nor wish them less to find so dark a cloud and heavy now does blind seems as my sun of life in them were spent o nature mother pitiful yet stern whence is the power which prompts thy wayward deeds such lovely things to make and mar in turn true from one living fount all power proceeds but how couldst thou consent great god of heaven that aught should rob the world of what thy love had given what though the ablest artists of old time left us the sculptured bust the imaged form of conq'ring alexander wrath o'ercame and made him for the while than philip less wrath to such fury valiant tydeus drove that dying he devour'd his slaughter'd foe wrath made not sylla merely blear of eye but blind to all and kill'd him in the end well valentinian knew that to such pain wrath leads and ajax he whose death it wrought strong against many 'gainst himself at last wrath is brief madness and when unrestrain'd long madness which its master often leads to shame and crime and haply e'en to death strange passing strange adventure when from one of the two brightest eyes which ever were beholding it with pain dis urb'd and dim moved influence which my own made dull and weak i had return'd to break the weary fast of seeing her my sole care in this world kinder to me were heaven and love than e'en if all their other gifts together join'd when from the right eyerather the right sun of my dear lady to my right eye came the ill which less my pain than pleasure makes as if it intellect possess'd and wings it pass'd as stars that shoot along the sky nature and pity then pursued their course thou little chamber'd haven to the woes whose daily tempest overwhelms my soul from shame i in heaven's light my grief control thou art its fountain which each night o'erflows my couch that oft hath woo'd me to repose 'mid sorrows vastlove's iv'ried hand hath stole griefs turgid stream which o'er thee it doth roll that hand which good on all but me bestows not only quiet and sweet rest i fly but from myself and thought whose vain pursuit on pinion'd fancy doth my soul transport the multitude i did so long defy now as my hope and refuge i salute so much i tremble solitude to court room which to me hast been a port and shield from life's rude daily tempests for long years now the full fountain of my nightly tears which in the day i bear for shame conceal'd bed which in woes so great wert wont to yield comfort and rest an urn of doubts and fears love o'er thee now from those fair hands uprears cruel and cold to me alone reveal'd but e'en than solitude and rest i flee more from myself and melancholy thought in whose vain quest my soul has heavenward flown the crowd long hateful hostile e'en to me strange though it sound for refuge have i sought such fear have i to find myself alone alas love bears me where i would not go and well i see how duty is transgress'd and how to her who queenlike rules my breast more than my wont importunate i grow never from rocks wise sailor guarded so his ship of richest merchandise possess'd as evermore i shield my bark distress'd from shocks of her hard pride that would o'erthrow torrents of tears fierce winds of infinite sighs for in my sea nights horrible and dark and pitiless winter reignhave driven my bark sailless and helmless where it shatter'd lies or drifting at the mercy of the main trouble to others bears distress to me and pain o love i err and i mine error own as one who burns whose fire within him lies and aggravates his grief while reason dies with its own martyrdom almost o'erthrown i strove mine ardent longing to restrain her fair calm face that i might ne'er disturb i can no more falls from my hand the curb and my despairing soul is bold again wherefore if higher than her wont she aim the act is thine who firest and spur'st her so no way too rough or steep for her to go but the rare heavenly gifts are most to blame shrined in herself let her at least feel this lest of my faults her pardon i should miss nor ocean holds such swarms amid his waves not overhead where circles the pale moon were stars so numerous ever seen by night nor dwell so many birds among the woods nor plants so many clothe the field or hill as holds my tost heart busy thoughts each eve each day i hope that this my latest eve shall part from my quick clay the sad salt waves and leave me in last sleep on some cold hill so many torments man beneath the moon ne'er bore as i have borne this know the woods through which i wander lonely day and night for never have i had a tranquil night but ceaseless sighs instead from morn till eve since love first made me tenant of the woods the sea ere i can rest shall lose his waves the sun his light shall borrow from the moon and april flowers be blasted o'er each hill thus to myself a prey from hill to hill pensive by day i roam and weep at night no one state mine but changeful as the moon and when i see approaching the brown eve sighs from my bosom from my eyes fall waves the herbs to moisten and to move the woods hostile the cities friendly are the woods to thoughts like mine which on this lofty hill mingle their murmur with the moaning waves through the sweet silence of the spangled night so that the livelong day i wait the eve when the sun sets and rises the fair moon would like endymion 'neath the enamour'd moon that slumbering i were laid in leafy woods and that ere vesper she who makes my eve with love and luna on that favour'd hill alone would come and stay but one sweet night while stood the sun nor sought his western waves upon the hard waves 'neath the beaming moon song that art born of night amid the woods thou shalt a rich hill see tomorrow eve count the ocean's finny droves count the twinkling host of stars round the night's pale orb that moves count the groves' wing'd choristers count each verdant blade that grows counted then will be my woes when shall these eyes cease to weep when shall this worldwearied frame cover'd by the cold sod sleep sure beneath yon planet's beam none like me have made such moan this to every bower is known sad my nights from morn till eve tenanting the woods i sigh but ere i shall cease to grieve ocean's vast bed shall be dry suns their light from moons shall gain and spring wither on each plain pensive weeping night and day from this shore to that i fly changeful as the lunar ray and when evening veils the sky then my tears might swell the floods then my sighs might bow the woods towns i hate the shades i love for relief to yon green height where the rill resounds i rove at the grateful calm of night there i wait the day's decline for the welcome moon to shine oh that in some lone retreat like endymion i were lain and that she who rules my fate there one night to stay would deign never from his billowy bed more might phoebus lift his head song that on the woodhung stream in the silent hour wert born witness'd but by cynthia's beam soon as breaks tomorrow's morn thou shalt seek a glorious plain there with laura to remain when music warbles from each thorn and zephyr's dewy wings sweep the young flowers what time the morn her crimson radiance flings then as the smiling year renews i feel renew'd love's tender pain renew'd is laura's cold disdain and i for comfort court the weeping muse oh could my sighs in accents flow so musically lorn that thou might'st catch my am'rous woe and cease proud maid thy scorn yet ere within thy icy breast the smallest spark of passion's found winter's cold temples shall be bound with all the blooms that paint spring's glowing vest the drops that bathe the griefdew'd eye the loveimpassion'd strain to move thy flinty bosom try full oftbut ah in vain would tears and melting song avail as vainly might the silken breeze that bends the flowers that fans the trees some rugged rock's tremendous brow assail both gods and men alike are sway'd by love as poets tell and i when flowers in every shade their bursting gems reveal first felt his allsubduing power while laura knows not yet the smart nor heeds the tortures of my heart my prayers my plaints and sorrow's pearly shower thy wrongs my soul with patience bear while life shall warm this clay and soothing sounds to laura's ear my numbers shall convey numbers with forceful magic charm all nature o'er the frostbound earth wake summer's fragrant buds to birth and the fierce serpent of its rage disarm the blossom'd shrubs in smiles are drest now laughs his purple plain and shall the nymph a foe profest to tenderness remain but oh what solace shall i find if fortune dooms me yet to bear the frowns of my relentless fair save with soft moan to vex the pitying wind in baffling nets the lightwing'd gale i'd fetter as it blows the vernal rose that scents the vale i'd cull on wintery snows still i'd ne'er hope that mind to move which dares defy the wiles of verse and love a kingly nature an angelic mind a spotless soul prompt aspect and keen eye quick penetration contemplation high and truly worthy of the breast which shrined in bright assembly lovely ladies join'd to grace that festival with gratulant joy amid so

stood though fair rejoiced in beauty's recompense by that strange act nay heart was quite undone oft have i pray'd to love and still i pray my charming agony my bitter joy that he would crave your grace if consciously from the right path my guilty footsteps stray that reason which o'er happier minds holds sway is quell'd of appetite i not deny and hence through tracks my better thoughts would

had kindled to a new delight by his own amorous and ardent ail though his first blow transfixing my best mail were mortal sure to push his triumph quite he took a shaft of sorrow in his right so my

my lifelong ache _h_ o wretch in whom vain thoughts and idle swell thou who thyself hast tutor'd to forget speak'st to thy heart as if 'twere with thee yet when to thy greatest bliss thou saidst farewell thou didst depart alone it stay'd with her nor cares from those bright eyes its home to stir o hill with green o'erspread with groves o'erhung where musing now now trilling her sweet lay most like what bards of heavenly spirits say sits she by fame through every region sung my heart which wisely unto her has clung more wise if there in absence blest it stay notes now the turf o'er which

notes where the turf is mark'd by her fair feet or from these eyes for her in sorrow drown'd then inly whispers as her steps advance would for awhile that wreteh were here alone who pines already o'er his bitter lot she conscious smiles not equal is the chance an eden thou while i a heartless stone o holy happy and beloved spot evil oppresses me and worse dismay to which a plain and ample way i find driven like thee by frantic passion blind urged by harsh thoughts i bend like thee my way nor know i if for war or peace to pray to war is ruin shame to peace assign'd but wherefore languish thusrather resign'd whate'er the will supreme ordains obey however ill that honour me beseem by thee conferr'd whom that affection cheats which many a perfect eye to error sways to raise thy spirit to that realm supreme my counsel is and win those blissful seats for short the time and few the allotted days the bad oppresses me the worse dismays to which so broad and plain a path i see my spirit to like frenzy led with thee tried by the same hard thoughts in dotage strays nor knows if peace or war of god it prays though great the loss and deep the shame to me but why pine longer best our lot will be what heaven's high will ordains when man obeys though i of that great honour worthless prove offer'd by theeherein love leads to err who often makes the sound eye to see wrong my counsel this instant on heaven above thy soul to elevate thy heart to spur for though the time be short the way is long two brilliant roses fresh from paradise which there on mayday morn in beauty sprung fair gift and by a lover old and wise equally offer'd to two lovers young at speech so tender and such winning guise as transports from a savage might have wrung a living lustre lit their mutual eyes and instant on their cheeks a soft blush hung the sun ne'er look'd upon a lovelier pair with a sweet smile and gentle sigh he said pressing the hands of both and turn'd away of words and roses each alike had share e'en now my worn heart thrill with joy and dread o happy eloquence o blessed day the balmy gale that with its tender sigh moves the green laurel and the golden hair makes with its graceful visitings and rare the gazer's spirit from his body fly a sweet and snowwhite rose in hard thorns set where in the world her fellow shall we find the glory of our age creator kind grant that ere hers my death shall first be met so the great public loss i may not see the world without its sun in darkness left and from my desolate eyes their sole light reft my mind with which no other thoughts agree mine ears which by no other sound are stirr'd except her ever pure and gentle word haply my style to some may seem too free in praise of her who holds my being's chain queen of her sex describing her to reign wise winning good fair noble chaste to be to me it seems not so i fear that she my lays as low and trifling may disdain worthy a higher and a better strain who thinks not with me let him come and see then will he say she whom his wishes seek is one indeed whose grace and worth might tire the muses of all lands and either lyre but mortal tongue for state divine is weak and may not soar by flattery and force as fate not choice ordains love rules its course who wishes to behold the utmost might of heaven and nature on her let him gaze sole sun not only in my partial lays but to the dark world blind to virtue's light and let him haste to view for death in spite the guilty leaves and on the virtuous preys for this loved angel heaven impatient stays and mortal charms are transient as they're bright here shall he see if timely he arrive virtue and beauty royalty of mind in one bless'd union join'd then shall he say that vainly my weak rhymes to praise her strive whose dazzling beams have struck my genius blind he must for ever weep if he delay stranger whose curious glance delights to trace what heaven and nature join'd to frame most rare here view mine eyes' bright suna sight so fair that purblind worlds like me enamour'd gaze but speed thy step for death with rapid pace pursues the best nor makes the bad his care call'd to the skies through yon blue fields of air on buoyant plume the mortal grace obeys then haste and mark in one rich form combined and for that dazzling lustre dimm'd mine eye chide the weak efforts of my trembling lay each charm of person and each power of mind but slowly if thy lingering foot comply grief and repentant shame shall mourn the brief delay o laura when my tortured mind the sad remembrance bears of that illomen'd day when victim to a thousand doubts and fears i left my soul behind that soul that could not from its partner stray in nightly visions to my longing eyes thy form oft seems to rise as ever thou wert seen fair like the rose 'midst paling flowers the queen but loosely in the wind unbraided wave the ringlets of thy hair that late with studious care i saw with pearls and flowery garlands twined on thy wan lip no cheerful smile appears thy beauteous face a tender sadness wears placid in pain thou seem'st serene in grief as conscious of thy fate and hopeless of relief cease cease presaging heart o angels deign to hear my fervent prayer that all my fears be vain what dread i feel when i revolve the day i left my mistress sad without repose my heart too with her and my fond thought knows nought on which gladlier oft'ner it can stay again my fancy doth her form portray meek among beauty's train like to some rose midst meaner flowers nor joy nor grief she shows not with misfortune prest but with dismay then were thrown by her custom'd cheerfulness her pearls her chaplets and her gay attire her song her laughter and her mild address thus doubtingly i quitted her i love now dark ideas dreams and bodings dire raise terrors which heaven grant may groundless prove to soothe me distant far in days gone by with dreams of one whose glance all heaven combined was mine now fears and sorrow haunt my mind nor can i from that grief those terrors fly for oft in sleep i mark within her eye deep pity with o'erwhelming sadness join'd and oft i seem to hear on every wind accents which from my breast chase peace and joy that last dark eve she cries remember'st thou when to those doting eyes i bade farewell forced by the time's relentless tyranny i had not then the power nor heart to tell what thou shalt find alas too surely true hope not again on earth thy laura's face to see o misery horror can it then be true that the sweet light before its time is spent 'mid all its pains which could my life content and ever with fresh hopes of good renew if so why sounds not other channels through nor only from herself the great event no god and nature could not thus consent and my dark fears are groundless and undue still it delights my heart to hope once more the welcome sight of that enchanting face the glory of our age and life to me but if to her eternal home to soar that heavenly spirit have left her earthly place oh then not distant may my last day be uncertain of my state i weep and sing i hope and tremble and with rhymes and sighs i ease my load while love his utmost tries how worse my sore afflicted heart to sting will her sweet seraph face again e'er bring their former light to these despairing eyes what to expect alas or how advise or must eternal grief my bosom wring for heaven which justly it deserves to win it cares not what on earth may be their fate whose sun it was where centred their sole gaze such terror so perpetual warfare in changed from my former self i live of late as one who midway doubts and fears and strays o angel looks o accents of the skies shall i or see or hear you once again o golden tresses which my heart enchain and lead it forth love's willing sacrifice o face of beauty given in anger's guise which still i not enjoy and still complain o dear delusion o bewitching pain transports at once my punishment and prize if haply those soft eyes some kindly beam eyes where my soul and all my thoughts reside vouchsafe in tender pity to bestow sudden of all my joys the murtheress tried fortune with steed or ship dispels the gleam fortune with stern behest still prompt to work my woe o gentle looks o words of heavenly sound shall i behold you hear you once again o waving locks that love has made the chain in which this wretched ruin'd heart is bound o face divine whose magic spells surround my soul distemper'd with unceasing pain o dear deceit o loving errors vain to hug the dart and doat upon the wound did those soft eyes in whose angelic light my life my thoughts a constant mansion find ever impart a pure unmixed delight or if they have one moment then unkind fortune steps in and sends me from their sight and gives my opening pleasures to the wind still do i wait to hear in vain still wait of that sweet enemy i love so well what now to think or say i cannot tell 'twixt hope and fear my feelings fluctuate the beautiful are still the marks of fate and sure her worth and beauty most excel what if her god have call'd her hence to dwell where virtue finds a more congenial state if so she will illuminate that sphere even as a sun but i'tis done with me i then am nothing have no business here o cruel absence why not let me see the worst my little tale is told i fear my scene is closed ere it accomplish'd be no tidings yeti listen but in vain of her my beautiful belovèd foe what or to think or say i nothing know so thrills my heart my fond hopes so sustain danger to some has in their beauty lain fairer and chaster she than others show god haply seeks to snatch from earth below virtue's best friend that heaven a star may gain or rather sun if what i dread be nigh my life its trials long its brief repose are ended all o cruel absence why didst thou remove me from the menaced woes my short sad story is already done and midway in its course my vain race run tranquil and happy loves in this agree the evening to desire and morning hate on me at eve redoubled sorrows wait morning is still the happier hour for me for then my sun and nature's oft i see opening at once the orient's rosy gate so match'd in beauty and in lustre great heaven seems enamour'd of our earth to be as when in verdant leaf the dear boughs burst whose roots have since so centred in my core another than myself is cherish'd more thus the two hours contrast day's last and first reason it is who calms me to desire and fear and hate who fiercer feed my fire oh that from her some vengeance i could wrest with words and glances who my peace destroys and then abash'd for my worse sorrow flies veiling her eyes so cruel yet so blest thus mine afflicted spirits and oppress'd by sure degrees she sorely drains and dries and in my heart as savage lion cries even at night when most i should have rest my soul which sleep expels from his abode the body leaves and from its trammels free seeks her whose mien so often menace show'd i marvel much if heard its advent be that while to her it spake and o'er her wept and round her clung asleep she alway kept on the fair face for which i long and sigh mine eyes were fasten'd with desire intense when to my fond thoughts love in best reply her honour'd hand uplifting shut me thence my heart there caughtas fish a fair hook by or as a young bird on a limèd fence for good deeds follow from example high to truth directed not its busied sense but of its one desire my vision reft as dreamingly soon oped itself a way which closed its bliss imperfect had been left my soul between those rival glories lay fill'd with a heavenly and new delight whose strange surpassing sweets engross'd it quite live sparks were glistening from her twin bright eyes so sweet on me whose lightning flashes beam'd and softly from a feeling heart and wise of lofty eloquence a rich flood stream'd even the memory serves to wake my sighs when i recall that day so glad esteem'd and in my heart its sinking spirit dies as some late grace her colder wont redeem'd my soul in pain and grief that most has been how great the power of constant habit is seems weakly 'neath its double joy to lean for at the sole taste of unusual bliss trembling with fear or thrill'd by idle hope oft on the point i've been life's door to ope still have i sought a life of solitude the streams the fields the forests know my mind that i might 'scape the sordid and the blind who paths forsake trod by the wise and good fain would i leave were mine own will pursued these tuscan haunts and these soft skies behind sorga's thickwooded hills again to find and sing and weep in concert with its flood but fortune ever my sore enemy compels my steps where i with sorrow see cast my fair treasure in a worthless soil yet less a foe she justly deigns to prove for once to me to laura and to love favouring my song my passion with her smile still have i sought a life of solitude this know the rivers and each wood and plain that i might 'scape the blind and sordid train who from the path have flown of peace and good could i my wish obtain how vainly would this cloudless climate woo me to remain sorga's embowering woods i'd seek again and sing weep wander by its friendly flood but ah my fortune hostile still to me compels me where i must indignant find amid the mire my fairest treasure thrown yet to my hand not all unworthy she now proves herself at least for once more kind sincebut alone to love and laura be it known in one fair star i saw two brilliant eyes with sweetness modesty so glistening o'er that soon those graceful nests of love before my worn heart learnt all others to despise equall'd not her whoever won the prize in ages gone on any foreign shore not she to greece whose wondrous beauty bore unnumber'd ills to troy death's anguish'd cries not the fair roman who with ruthless blade piercing her chaste and outraged bosom fled dishonour worse than death like charms display'd such excellence should brightest glory shed on nature as on me supreme delight but ah too lately come too soon it takes its flight feels any fair the glorious wish to gain of sense of worth of courtesy the praise on those bright eyes attentive let her gaze of her miscall'd my love but sure my foe honour to gain with love of god to glow virtue more bright how native grace displays may there be learn'd and by what surest ways to heaven that for her coming pants to go the converse sweet beyond what poets write is there the winning silence and the meek and saintlike manners man would paint in vain the matchless beauty dazzling to the sight can ne'er be learn'd for bootless 'twere to seek by art what by kind chance alone we gain methinks that life in lovely woman first and after life true honour should be dear nay wanting honourof all wants the worst friend nought remains of loved or lovely here and who alas has honour's barrier burst unsex'd and dead though fair she yet appear leads a vile life in shame and torment curst a lingering death where all is dark and drear to me no marvel was lucretia's end save that she needed when that last disgrace alone sufficed to kill a sword to die sophists in vain the contrary defend their arguments are feeble all and base and truth alone triumphant mounts on high tree victory's bright guerdon wont to crown heroes and bards with thy triumphal leaf how many days of mingled joy and grief have i from thee through life's short passage known lady who reckless of the world's renown reapest in virtue's field fair honour's sheaf nor fear'st love's limed snares that subtle thief while calm discretion on his wiles looks down the pride of birth with all that here we deem most precious gems and gold's resplendent grace abject alike in thy regard appear nay even thine own unrivall'd beauties beam no charm to theesave as their circling blaze clasps fitly that chaste soul which still thou hold'st most dear blest laurel fadeless and triumphant tree of kings and poets thou the fondest pride how much of joy and sorrow's changing tide in my short breath hath been awaked by thee lady the will's sweet sovereign thou canst see no bliss but virtue where thou dost preside love's chain his snare thou dost alike deride from man's deceit thy wisdom sets thee free birth's native pride and treasure's precious store whose bright possession we so fondly hail to thee as burthens valueless appear thy beauty's excellencenone viewed before thy soul had weariedbut thou lov'st the veil that shrine of purity adorneth here ceaseless i think and in each wasting thought so strong a pity for myself appears that often it has brought my harass'd heart to new yet natural tears seeing each day my end of life draw nigh instant in prayer i ask of god the wings with which the spirit springs freed from its mortal coil to bliss on high but nothing to this hour prayer tear or sigh whatever man could do my hopes sustain and so indeed in justice should it be able to stay who went and fell that he should prostrate in his own despite remain but lo the tender arms in which i trust are open to me still though fears my bosom fill of others' fate and my own heart alarms which worldly feelings spur haply to utmost ill one thought thus parleys with my troubled mind what still do you desire whence succour wait ah wherefore to this great this guilty loss of time so madly blind take up at length wisely take up your part tear every root of pleasure from your heart which ne'er can make it blest nor lets it freely play nor calmly rest if long ago with tedium and disgust you view'd the false and fugitive delights with which its tools a treacherous world requites why longer then repose in it your trust whence peace and firmness are in exile thrust while life and vigour stay the bridle of your thoughts is in your power grasp guide it while you may so clogg'd with doubt so dangerous is delay the best for wise reform is still the present hour well known to you what rapture still has been shed on your eyes by the dear sight of her whom for your peace it were better if she the light had never seen and you remember well as well you ought her image when as with one conquering bound your heart in prey she caught where flame from other light no entrance found she fired it and if that fallacious heat lasted long years expecting still one day which for our safety came not to repay it lifts you now to hope more blest and sweet uplooking to that heaven around your head immortal glorious spread if but a glance a brief word an old song had here such power to charm your eager passion glad of its own harm how far 'twill then exceed if now the joy so strong another thought the while severe and sweet laborious yet delectable in scope takes in my heart its seat filling with glory feeding it with hope till bent alone on bright and deathless fame it feels not when i freeze or burn in flame when i am pale or ill and if i crush it rises stronger still this from my helpless cradle day by day has strengthen'd with my strength grown with my growth till haply now one tomb must cover both when from the flesh the soul has pass'd away no more this passion comrades it as here for fameif after death learning speak aught of meis but a breath wherefore because i fear hopes to indulge which the next hour may chase i would old error leave and the one truth embrace but the third wish which fills and fires my heart o'ershadows all the rest which near it spring time too dispels a part while but for her selfreckless grown i sing and then the rare light of those beauteous eyes sweetly before whose gentle heat i melt as a fine curb is felt to combat which avails not wit or force what boots it trammell'd by such adverse ties if still between the rocks must lie her course to trim my little bark to new emprize ah wilt thou never lord who yet dost keep me safe and free from common chains which bind in different modes mankind deign also from my brow this shame to sweep for as one sunk in sleep methinks death ever present to my sight yet when i would resist i have no arms to fight full well i see my state in nought deceived by truth ill known but rather forced by love who leaves not him to move in honour who too much his grace believed for o'er my heart from time to time i feel a subtle scorn a lively anguish steal whence every hidden thought where all may see upon my brow is writ for with such faith on mortal things to dote as unto god alone is just and fit disgraces worst the prize who covets most should reason amid things of sense be lost this loudly calls her to the proper track but when she would obey and home return ill habits keep her back and to my view portray her who was only born my death to be too lovely in herself too loved alas by me i neither know to me what term of life heaven destined when on earth i came at first to suffer this sharp strife 'gainst my own peace which i myself have nursed nor can i for the veil my body throws yet see the time when my sad life may close i feel my frame begin to fail and vary each desire within and now that i believe my parting day is near at hand or else not distant lies like one whom losses wary make and wise i travel back in thought where first the way the righthand way i left to peace which led while through me shame and grief recalling the vain past on this side spread on that brings no relief passion whose strength i now from habit feel so great that it would dare with death itself to deal song i am here my heart the while more cold with fear than frozen snow feels in its certain core death's coming blow for thus in weak selfcommuning has roll'd of my vain life the better portion by worse burden surely ne'er tried mortal man than that which now i bear though death be seated nigh for future life still seeking councils new i know and love the good yet ah the worse pursue hard heart and cold a stern will past belief in angel form of gentle sweet allure if thus her practised rigour long endure o'er me her triumph will be poor and brief for when or spring or die flower herb and leaf when day is brightest night when most obscure alway i weep great cause from fortune sure from love and laura have i for my grief i live in hope alone remembering still how by long fall of small drops i have seen marble and solid stone that worn have been no heart there is so hard so cold no will by true tears fervent prayers and faithful love that will not deign at length to melt and move my lord and friend thoughts wishes all inclined my heart to visit one so dear to me but fortunecan she ever worse decree held me in hand misled or kept behind since then the dear desire love taught my mind but leads me to a death i did not see and while my twin lights wheresoe'er i be are still denied by day and night i've pined affection for my lord my lady's love the bonds have been wherewith in torments long i have been bound which round myself i wove a laurel green a column fair and strong this for three lustres that for three years more in my fond breast nor wish'd it free i bore [illustration selva piana near parma] woe for the 'witching look of that fair face the port where ease with dignity combined woe for those accents that each savage mind to softness tuned to noblest thoughts the base and the sweet smile from whence the dart i trace which now leaves death my only hope behind exalted soul most fit on thrones to 've shined but that too late she came this earth to grace for you i still must burn and breathe in you for i was ever yours of you bereft full little now i reck all other care with hope and with desire you thrill'd me through when last my only joy on earth i left but caught by winds each word was lost in air alas that touching glance that beauteous face alas that dignity with sweetness fraught alas that speech which tamed the wildest thought that roused the coward glory to embrace alas that smile which in me did encase that fatal dart whence here i hope for nought oh hadst thou earlier our regions sought the world had then confess'd thy sovereign grace in thee i breathed life's flame was nursed by thee for i was thine and since of thee bereaved each other woe hath lost its venom'd sting my soul's blest joy when last thy voice on me in music fell my heart sweet hope conceived alas thy words have sped on zephyrs' wings what should i do what love dost thou advise full time it is to die and longer than i wish have i delay'd my mistress is no more and with her gone my heart to follow her i must need break short the course of my afflictive years to view her here below i ne'er can hope and irksome 'tis to wait since that my every joy by her departure unto tears is turn'd of all its sweets my life has been deprived thou love dost feel therefore to thee i plain how grievous is my loss i know my sorrows grieve and weigh thee down e'en as our common cause for on one rock we both have wreck'd our bark and in one instant was its sun obscured what genius can with words rightly describe my lamentable state ah blind ungrateful world thou hast indeed just cause with me to mourn that beauty thou didst hold with her is fled fall'n is thy glory and thou seest it not unworthy thou with her while here she dwelt acquaintance to maintain or to be trodden by her saintly feet for that which is so fair should with its presence decorate the skies but i a wretch who reft of her prize nor myself nor mortal life recall her with my tears this only of my hope's vast sum remains and this alone doth still support me here ah me her charming face is earth become which wont unto our thought to picture heaven and happiness above her viewless form inhabits paradise divested of that veil which shadow'd while below her bloom of life once more to put it on and never then to cast it off again when so much more divine and glorious render'd 'twill by us be view'd as mortal beauty to eternal yields more bright than ever and a lovelier fair before me she appears where most she's conscious that her sight will please this is one pillar that sustains my life the other her dear name that to my heart sounds so delightfully but tracing in my mind that she who form'd my choicest hope is dead e'en in her blossom'd prime thou knowest love full well what i become she i trust sees it too who dwells with truth ye sweet associates who admired her charms her life angelical and her demeanour heavenly upon earth for me lament and be by pity wrought no wise for her who risen to so much peace me has in warfare left such that should any shut the road to follow her for some length of time what love declares to me alone would check my cutting through the tie but in this guise he reasons from within the mighty grief transporting thee restrain for passions uncontroll'd forfeit that heaven to which thy soul aspires where she is living whom some fancy dead while at her fair remains she smiles herself sighing for thee alone and that her fame which lives in many a clime hymn'd by thy tongue may ne'er become extinct she prays but that her name should harmonize thy voice if e'er her eyes were lovely held and dear fly the calm green retreat and ne'er approach where song and laughter dwell o strain but wail be thine it suits thee ill with the glad throng to stay thou sorrowing widow wrapp'd in garb of woe fall'n that proud column fall'n that laurel tree whose shelter once relieved my wearied mind i'm reft of what i ne'er again shall find though ransack'd every shore and every sea double the treasure death has torn from me in which life's pride was with its pleasure join'd not eastern gems nor the world's wealth combined can give it back nor land nor royalty but if so fate decrees what can i more than with unceasing tears these eyes bedew abase my visage and my lot deplore ah what is life so lovely to the view how quickly in one little morn is lost what years have won with labour and with cost my laurell'd hope and thou colonna proud your broken strength can shelter me no more nor boreas auster indus afric's shore can give me that whose loss my soul hath bow'd my step exulting and my joy avow'd death now hath quench'd with ye my heart's twin store nor earth's high rule nor gems nor gold's bright ore can e'er bring back what once my heart endow'd but if this grief my destiny hath will'd what else can i oppose but tearful eyes a sorrowing bosom and a spirit quell'd o life whose vista seems so brightly fill'd a sunny breath and that exhaling dies the hope oft many watchful years have swell'd if thou wouldst have me love thy slave again one other proof miraculous and new must yet be wrought by you ere conquer'd i resume my ancient chain lift my dear love from earth which hides her now for whose sad loss thus beggar'd i remain once more with warmth endow that wise chaste heart where wont my life to dwell and if as some divine thy influence so from highest heaven unto the depths of hell prevail in soothfor what its scope below 'mid us of common race methinks each gentle breast may answer well rob death of his late triumph and replace thy conquering ensign in her lovely face relume on that fair brow the living light which was my honour'd guide and the sweet flame though spent which still the same kindles me now as when it burn'd most bright for thirsty hind with such desire did ne'er long for green pastures or the crystal brook as i for the dear look whence i have borne so much andif aright i read myself and passionmore must bear this makes me to one theme my thoughts thus bind an aimless wanderer where is pathway none with weak and wearied mind pursuing hopes which never can be won hence to thy summons answer i disdain thine is no power beyond thy proper reign give me again that gentle voice to hear as in my heart are heard its echoes still which had in song the skill hate to disarm rage soften sorrow cheer to tranquillize each tempest of the mind and from dark lowering clouds to keep it clear which sweetly then refined and raised my verse where now it may not soar and with desire that hope may equal vie since now my mind is waked in strength restore their proper business to my ear and eye awanting which life must all tasteless be and harder than to die vainly with me to your old power you trust while my first love is shrouded still in dust give her dear glance again to bless my sight which as the sun on snow beam'd still for me open each window bright where pass'd my heart whence no return can be resume thy golden shafts prepare thy bow and let me once more drink with old delight of that dear voice the sound whence what love is i first was taught to know and for the lures which still i covet so were rifest richest there my soul that bound waken to life her tongue and on the breeze let her light silken hair loosen'd by love's own fingers float at ease do this and i thy willing yoke will bear else thy hope faileth my free will to snare oh never my gone heart those links of gold artlessly negligent or curl'd with grace nor her enchanting face sweetly severe can captive cease to hold these night and day the amorous wish in me kept more than laurel or than myrtle green when doff'd or donn'd we see of fields the grass of woods their leafy screen and since that death so haughty stands and stern the bond now broken whence i fear'd to flee nor thine the art howe'er the world may turn to bind anew the chain what boots it love old arts to try again their day is pass'd thy power since lost the arms which were my terror once no longer harms thy arms were then her eyes unrivall'd whence live darts were freely shot of viewless flame no help from reason came for against heaven avails not man's defence thought silence feeling gaiety wit sense modest demeanour affable discourse in words of sweetest force whence every grosser nature gentle grew that angel air humble to all and kind whose praise it needs not mine from all we find stood she or sat a grace which often threw doubt on the gazer's mind to which the meed of highest praise was due o'er hardest hearts thy victory was sure with arms like these which lost i am secure the minds which heaven abandons to thy reign haply are bound in many times and ways but mine one only chain its wisdom shielding me from more obeys yet freedom brings no joy though that he burst rather i mournful ask sweet pilgrim mine alas what doom divine me earliest bound to life yet frees thee first god who has snatch'd thee from the world so soon only to kindle our desires the boon of virtue so complete and lofty gave now love i may deride thy future wounds nor fear to be thy slave in vain thy bow is bent its bolts fall wide when closed her brilliant eyes their virtue died death from thy every law my heart has freed she who my lady was is pass'd on high leaving me free to count dull hours drag by to solitude and sorrow still decreed that burning toil in which i once was caught while twice ten years and one i counted o'er death has unloosed like burden i ne'er bore that grief ne'er fatal proves i now am taught but love who to entangle me still sought spread in the treacherous grass his net once more so fed the fire with fuel as before that my escape i hardly could have wrought and but that my first woes experience gave snarèd long since and kindled i had been and all the more as i'm become less green my freedom death again has come to save and break my bond that flame now fades and fails 'gainst which nor force nor intellect prevails life passes quick nor will a moment stay and death with hasty journeys still draws near and all the present joins my soul to tear with every past and every future day and to look back or forward so does prey on this distracted breast that sure i swear did i not to myself some pity bear i were e'en now from all these thoughts away much do i muse on what of pleasures past this woeworn heart has known meanwhile t' oppose my passage loud the winds around me roar i see my bliss in port and torn my mast and sails my pilot faint with toil and those fair lights that wont to guide me now no more life ever flies with course that nought may stay death follows after with gigantic stride ills past and present on my spirit prey and future evils threat on every side whether i backward look or forward fare a thousand ills my bosom's peace molest and were it not that pity bids me spare my nobler part i from these thoughts would rest if ever aught of sweet my heart has known remembrance wakes its charms while tempest tost i mark the clouds that o'er my course still frown e'en in the port i see the storm afar weary my pilot mast and cable lost and set for ever my fair polar star what dost thou think'st thou wherefore bend thine eye back on the time that never shall return the raging fire where once 'twas thine to burn why with fresh fuel wretched soul supply those thrilling tones those glances of the sky which one by one thy fond verse strove to adorn are fled andwell thou knowest poor forlorn to seek them here were bootless industry then toil not bliss so fleeting to renew to chase a thought so fair so faithless cease thou rather that unwavering good pursue which guides to heaven since nought below can please fatal for us that beauty's torturing view living or dead alike which desolates our peace o tyrant thoughts vouchsafe me some repose sufficeth not that love and death and fate make war all round me to my very gate but i must in me armèd hosts enclose and thou my heart to me alone that shows disloyal still what cruel guides of late in thee find shelter now the chosen mate of my most mischievous and bitter foes love his most secret embassies in thee in thee her worst results hard fate explains and death the memory of that blow to me which shatters all that yet of hope remains in thee vague thoughts themselves with error arm and thee alone i blame for all my harm mine eyes our glorious sun is veil'd in night or set to us to rise 'mid realms of love there we may hail it still and haply prove it mourn'd that we delay'd our heavenward flight mine ears the music of her tones delight those who its harmony can best approve my feet who in her track so joy'd to move ye cannot penetrate her regions bright but wherefore should your wrath on me descend no spell of mine hath hush'd for ye the joy of seeing hearing feeling she was near go war with deathyet rather let us bend to him who can createwho can destroy and bids the ready smile succeed the tear o my sad eyes our sun is overcast nay rather borne to heaven and there is shining waiting our coming and perchance repining at our delay there shall we meet at last and there mine ears her angel words float past those who best understand their sweet divining howe'er my feet unto the search inclining ye cannot reach her in those regions vast why then do ye torment me thus for oh it is no fault of mine that ye no more behold and hear and welcome her below blame deathor rather praise him and adore who binds and frees restrains and letteth go and to the weeping one can joy restore since her calm angel face long beauty's fane my beggar'd soul by this brief parting throws in darkest horrors and in deepest woes i seek by uttering to allay my pain certes just sorrow leads me to complain this she who is its cause and love too shows no other remedy my poor heart knows against the troubles that in life obtain death thou hast snatch'd her hence with hand unkind and thou glad earth that fair and kindly face now hidest from me in thy close embrace why leave me here disconsolate and blind since she who of mine eyes the light has been sweet loving bright no more with me is seen if love to give new counsel still delay my life must change to other scenes than these my troubled spirit grief and terror freeze desire augments while all my hopes decay thus ever grows my life by night and day despondent and dismay'd and ill at ease harass'd and helmless on tempestuous seas with no sure escort on a doubtful way her path a sick imagination guides its true light underneathah no on high whence on my heart she beams more bright than eye not on mine eyes from them a dark veil hides those lovely orbs and makes me ere life's span is measured half an old and broken man e'en in youth's fairest flower when love's dear sway is wont with strongest power our hearts to bind leaving on earth her fleshly veil behind my life my laura pass'd from me away living and fair and free from our vile clay from heaven she rules supreme my willing mind alas why left me in this mortal rind that first of peace of sin that latest day as my fond thoughts her heavenward path pursue so may my soul glad light and ready be to follow her and thus from troubles flee whate'er delays me as worst loss i rue time makes me to myself but heavier grow death had been sweet today three years ago if the lorn bird complain or rustling sweep soft summer airs o'er foliage waving slow or the hoarse brook come murmuring down the steep where on the enamell'd bank i sit below with thoughts of love that bid my numbers flow 'tis then i see her though in earth she sleep her form'd in heaven i see and hear and know responsive sighing weeping as i weep alas she pitying says ere yet the hour why hurry life away with swifter flight why from thy eyes this flood of sorrow pour no longer mourn my fate through death my days become eternal to eternal light these eyes which seem'd in darkness closed i raise where the green leaves exclude the summer beam and softly bend as balmy breezes blow and where with liquid lapse the lucid stream across the fretted rock is heard to flow pensive i lay when she whom earth conceals as if still living to my eye appears and pitying heaven her angel form reveals to say unhappy petrarch dry your tears ah why sad lover thus before your time in grief and sadness should your life decay and like a blighted flower your manly prime in vain and hopeless sorrow fade away ah yield not thus to culpable despair but raise thine eyes to heaven and think i wait thee there moved by the summer wind when all is still the light leaves quiver on the yielding spray sighs from its flowery bank the lucid rill while the birds answer in their sweetest lay vain to this sickening heart these scenes appear no form but hers can meet my tearful eyes in every passing gale her voice i hear it seems to tell me i have heard thy sighs but why she cries in manhood's towering prime in grief's dark mist thy days inglorious hide ah dost thou murmur that my span of time has join'd eternity's unchanging tide yes though i seem'd to shut mine eyes in night they only closed to wake in everlasting light nowhere before could i so well have seen her whom my soul most craves since lost to view nowhere in so great freedom could have been breathing my amorous lays 'neath skies so blue never with depths of shade so calm and green a valley found for lover's sigh more true methinks a spot so lovely and serene love not in cyprus nor in gnidos knew all breathes one spell all prompts and prays that i like them should lovethe clear sky the calm hour winds waters birds the green bough the gay flower but thou beloved who call'st me from on high by the sad memory of thine early fate pray that i hold the world and these sweet snares in hate never till now so clearly have i seen her whom my eyes desire my soul still views never enjoy'd a freedom thus serene ne'er thus to heaven breathed my enamour'd muse as in this vale sequester'd darkly green where my soothed heart its pensive thought pursues and nought intrusively may intervene and all my sweetlytender sighs renews to love and meditation faithful shade receive the breathings of my grateful breast love not in cyprus found so sweet a nest as this by pine and arching laurel made the birds breeze water branches whisper love herb flower and verdant path the lay symphonious move how oft all lonely to my sweet retreat from man and from myself i strive to fly bathing with dewy eyes each muchloved seat and swelling every blossom with a sigh how oft deep musing on my woes complete along the dark and silent glens i lie in thought again that dearest form to meet by death possess'd and therefore wish to die how oft i see her rising from the tide of sorga like some goddess of the flood or pensive wander by the river's side or tread the flowery mazes of the wood bright as in life while angel pity throws o'er her fair face the impress of my woes o blessed spirit who dost oft return ministering comfort to my nights of woe from eyes which death relenting in his blow has lit with all the lustres of the morn how am i gladden'd that thou dost not scorn o'er my dark days thy radiant beam to throw thus do i seem again to trace below thy beauties hovering o'er their loved sojourn there now thou seest where long of thee had been my sprightlier strain of thee my plaint i swell of theeoh no of mine own sorrows keen one only solace cheers the wretched scene by many a sign i know thy coming well thy step thy voice and look and robe of favour'd green when welcome slumber locks my torpid frame i see thy spirit in the midnight dream thine eyes that still in living lustre beam in all but frail mortality the same ah then from earth and all its sorrows free methinks i meet thee in each former scene once the sweet shelter of a heart serene now vocal only while i weep for thee for theeah no from human ills secure thy hallow'd soul exults in endless day 'tis i who linger on the toilsome way no balm relieves the anguish i endure save the fond feeble hope that thou art near to soothe my sufferings with an angel's tear death thou of fairest face hast 'reft the hue and quench'd in deep thick night the brightest eyes and loosed from all its tenderest closest ties a spirit to faith and ardent virtue true in one short hour to all my bliss adieu hush'd are those accents worthy of the skies unearthly sounds whose loss awakes my sighs and all i hear is grief and all i view yet oft to soothe this lone and anguish'd heart by pity led she comes my couch to seek nor find i other solace here below and if her thrilling tones my strain could speak and look divine with love's enkindling dart not man's sad breast alone but fiercest beasts should glow thou hast despoil'd the fairest face e'er seen thou hast extinguish'd death the brightest eyes and snapp'd the cord in sunder of the ties which bound that spirit brilliantly serene in one short moment all i love has been torn from me and dark silence now supplies those gentle tones my heart which bursts with sighs nor sight nor sound from weariness can screen yet doth my lady by compassion led return to solace my unfailing woe earth yields no other balmoh could i tell how bright she seems and how her accents flow not unto man alone love's flames would spread but even bears and tigers share the spell so brief the time so fugitive the thought which laura yields to me though dead again small medicine give they to my giant pain still as i look on her afflicts me nought love on the rack who holds me as he brought fears when he sees her thus my soul retain where still the seraph face and sweet voice reign which first his tyranny and triumph wrought as rules a mistress in her home of right from my dark heavy heart her placid brow dispels each anxious thought and omen drear my soul which bears but ill such dazzling light says with a sigh o blessed day when thou didst ope with those dear eyes thy passage here ne'er did fond mother to her darling son or zealous spouse to her belovèd mate sage counsel give in perilous estate with such kind caution in such tender tone as gives that fair one who oft looking down on my hard exile from her heavenly seat with wonted kindness bends upon my fate her brow as friend or parent would have done now chaste affection prompts her speech now fear instructive speech that points what several ways to seek or shun while journeying here below then all the ills of life she counts and prays my soul ere long may quit this terrene sphere and by her words alone i'm soothed and freed from woe ne'er to the son in whom her age is blest the anxious mothernor to her loved lord the wedded dame impending ill to ward with careful sighs so faithful counsel press'd as she who from her high eternal rest bendingas though my exile she deplored with all her wonted tenderness restored and softer pity on her brow impress'd now with a mother's fears and now as one who loves with chaste affection in her speech she points what to pursue and what to shun our years retracing of long various grief wooing my soul at higher good to reach and while she speaks my bosom finds relief if that soft breath of sighs which from above i hear of her so long my lady here who now in heaven yet seems as of our sphere to breathe and move to feel and live and love i could but paint my passionate verse should move warmest desires so jealous yet so dear o'er me she bends and breathes without a fear that on the way i tire or turn or rove she points the path on high and i who know her chaste anxiety and earnest prayer in whispers sweet affectionate and low train at her will my acts and wishes there and find such sweetness in her words alone as with their power should melt the hardest stone o friend though left a wretched pilgrim here by thee though left in solitude to roam yet can i mourn that thou hast found thy home on angel pinions borne in bright career now thou behold'st the everturning sphere and stars that journey round the concave dome now thou behold'st how short of truth we come how blind our judgment and thine own how clear that thou art happy soothes my soul oppress'd o friend salute from me the laurell'd band guitton and cino dante and the rest and tell my laura friend that here i stand wasting in tears scarce of myself possess'd while her blest beauties all my thoughts command sennuccio mine i yet myself console though thou hast left me mournful and alone for eagerly to heaven thy spirit has flown free from the flesh which did so late enrol thence at one view commands it either pole the planets and their wondrous courses known and human sight how brief and doubtful shown thus with thy bliss my sorrow i control one favourin the third of those bright spheres guido and dante cino too salute with franceschin and all that tuneful train and tell my lady how i live in tears savage and lonely as some forest brute her sweet face and fair works when memory brings again to every sound save sighs this air is mute when from rude rocks i view the smiling land where she was born who held my life in hand from its first bud till blossoms turn'd to fruit to heaven she's gone and i'm left destitute to mourn her loss and cast around in pain these wearied eyes which seeking her in vain where'er they turn o'erflow with grief acute there's not a root or stone amongst these hills nor branch nor verdant leaf 'midst these soft glades nor in the valley flowery herbage grows nor liquid drop the sparkling fount distils nor savage beast that shelters in these shades but knows how sharp my griefhow deep my woes my noble flamemore fair than fairest are whom kind heaven here has e'er in favour shown before her time alas for me has flown to her celestial home and parent star i seem but now to wake wherein a bar she placed on passion 'twas for good alone as with a gentle coldness all her own she waged with my hot wishes virtuous war my thanks on her for such wise care i press that with her lovely face and sweet disdain she check'd my love and taught me peace to gain o graceful artifice deserved success i with my fond verse with her bright eyes she glory in her she virtue got in me how goes the world now please me and delight what most displeased me now i see and feel my trials were vouchsafed me for my weal that peace eternal should brief war requite o hopes and wishes ever fond and slight in lovers most which oftener harm than heal worse had she yielded to my warm appeal whom heaven has welcomed from the grave's dark night but blind love and my dull mind so misled i sought to trespass even by main force where to have won my precious soul were dead blessèd be she who shaped mine erring course to better port by turns who curb'd and lured my bold and passionate will where safety was secured alas this changing world my present joy was once my grief's dark source and now i feel my sufferings pass'd were but my soul to heal its fearful warfarepeace's soft decoy poor human wishes hope thou fragile toy to lovers oft my woe had met its seal had she but hearken'd to my love's appeal who throned in heaven hath fled this world's alloy my blinded love and yet more stubborn mind resistless urged me to my bosom's shame and where my soul's destruction i had met but blessèd she who bade life's current find a holier course who still'd my spirit's flame with gentle hope that soul might triumph yet when from the heavens i see aurora beam with rosytinctured cheek and golden hair love bids my face the hue of sadness wear there laura dwells i with a sigh exclaim thou knowest well the hour that shall redeem happy tithonus thy muchvalued fair but not to her i love can i repair till death extinguishes this vital flame yet need'st thou not thy separation mourn certain at evening's close is the return of her who doth not thy hoar locks despise but my nights sad my days are render'd drear by her who bore my thoughts to yonder skies and only a remember'd name left here when from the east appears the purple ray of morn arising and salutes the eyes that wear the night in watching for the day thus speaks my heart in yonder opening skies in yonder fields of bliss my laura lies thou sun that know'st to wheel thy burning car each eve to the still surface of the deep and there within thy thetis' bosom sleep oh could i thus my laura's presence share how would my patient heart its sorrows bear adored in life and honour'd in the dust she that in this fond breast for ever reigns has pass'd the gulph of deathto deck that bust no trace of her but the sad name remains the eyes the face the limbs of heavenly mould so long the theme of my impassion'd lay charms which so stole me from myself away that strange to other men the course i hold the crispèd locks of pure and lucid gold the lightning of the angelic smile whose ray to earth could all of paradise convey a little dust are nowto feeling cold and yet i livebut that i live bewail sunk the loved light that through the tempest led my shatter'd bark bereft of mast and sail hush'd be for aye the song that breathed love's fire lost is the theme on which my fancy fed and turn'd to mourning my once tuneful lyre the eyes the arms the hands the feet the face which made my thoughts and words so warm and wild that i was almost from myself exiled and render'd strange to all the human race the lucid locks that curl'd in golden grace the lightening beam that when my angel smiled diffused o'er earth an eden heavenly mild what are they now dust lifeless dust alas and i live on a melancholy slave toss'd by the tempest in a shatter'd bark reft of the lovely light that cheer'd the wave the flame of genius too extinct and dark here let my lays of love conclusion have mute be the lyre tears best my sorrows mark those eyes whose living lustre shed the heat of bright meridian day the heavenly mould of that angelic form the hands the feet the taper arms the crispèd locks of gold charms that the sweets of paradise enfold the radiant lightning of her angelsmile and every grace that could the sense beguile are now a pile of ashes deadly cold and yet i bear to drag this cumbrous chain that weighs my soul to earthto bliss or pain alike insensibleher anchor lost the frail dismantled bark all tempesttoss'd surveys no port of comfortclosed the scene of life's delusive joysand dry the muse's vein those eyes sweet subject of my rapturous strain the arms the hands the feet that lovely face by which i from myself divided was and parted from the vulgar and the vain those crispèd locks pure gold unknown to stain of that angelic smile the lightening grace which wont to make this earth a heavenly place dissolved to senseless ashes now remain and yet i live to endless grief a prey 'reft of that star my loved my certain guide disarm'd my bark while tempests round me blow stop then my versedry is the fountain's tide that fed my genius cease my amorous lay changed is my lyre attuned to endless woe had i e'er thought that to the world so dear the echo of my sighs would be in rhyme i would have made them in my sorrow's prime rarer in style in number more appear since she is dead my muse who prompted here first in my thoughts and feelings at all time all power is lost of tender or sublime my rough dark verse to render soft and clear and certes my sole study and desire was buti knew not howin those long years to unburthen my sad heart not fame acquire i wept but wish'd no honour in my tears fain would i now taste joy but that high fair silent and weary calls me to her there oh had i deem'd my sighs in numbers rung could e'er have gain'd the world's approving smile i had awoke my rhymes in choicer style my sorrow's birth more tunefully had sung but she is gone whose inspiration hung on all my words and did my thoughts beguile my numbers harsh seem'd melody awhile now she is mute who o'er them music flung nor fame nor other incense then i sought but how to quell my heart's o'erwhelming grief i wept but sought no honour in my tear but could the world's fair suffrage now be bought 'twere joy to gain but that my hour is brief her lofty spirit waves me to her bier she stood within my heart warm young alone as in a humble home a lady bright by her last flight not merely am i grown mortal but dead and she an angel quite a soul whence every bliss and hope is flown love shorn and naked of its own glad light might melt with pity e'en a heart of stone but none there is to tell their grief or write these plead within where deaf is every ear except mine own whose power its griefs so mar that nought is left me save to suffer here verily we but dust and shadows are verily blind and evil is our will verily human hopes deceive us still 'mid life's bright glow she dwelt within my soul the sovereign tenant of a humble cell but when for heaven she bade the world farewell death seem'd to grasp me in his fierce control my wither'd love torn from its brightening goal my soul without its treasure doom'd to dwell could i but trace their grief their sorrow tell a stone might wake and fain with them condole they inly mourn where none can hear their woe save i alone who too with grief oppress'd can only soothe my anguish by my sighs life is indeed a shadowy dream below our blind desires by reason's chain unbless'd whilst hope in treacherous wither'd fragments lies my thoughts in fair alliance and array hold converse on the theme which most endears pity approaches and repents delay e'en now she speaks of us or hopes or fears since the last day the terrible hour when fate this present life of her fair being reft from heaven she sees and hears and feels our state no other hope than this to me is left o fairest miracle most fortunate mind o unexampled beauty stately rare whence lent too late too soon alas rejoin'd hers is the crown and palm of good deeds there who to the world so eminent and clear made her great virtue and my passion here my thoughts were wont with sentiment so sweet to meditate their object in my breast perhaps her sympathies my wishes meet with gentlest pity seeing me distress'd nor when removed to that her sacred rest the present life changed for that blest retreat vanish'd in air my former visions fleet my hopes my tears in vain to her address'd o lovely miracle o favour'd mind beauty beyond example high and rare so soon return'd from us to whence it came there the immortal wreaths her temples bind the sacred palm is hers on earth so fair who shone by her own virtues and my flame i now excuse myself who wont to blame nay more i prize and even hold me dear for this fair prison this sweetbitter shame which i have borne conceal'd so many a year o envious fates that rare and golden frame rudely ye broke where lightly twined and clear yarn of my bonds the threads of worldwide fame which lovely 'gainst his wont made death appear for not a soul was ever in its days of joy of liberty of life so fond that would not change for her its natural ways preferring thus to suffer and despond than fed by hope to sing in others' praise content to die or live in such a bond two mortal foes in one fair breast combined beauty and virtue in such peace allied that ne'er rebellion ruffled that pure mind but in rare union dwelt they side by side by death they now are shatter'd and disjoin'd one is in heaven its glory and its pride one under earth her brilliant eyes now blind whence stings of love once issued far and wide that winning air that rare discourse and meek surely from heaven inspired that gentle glance which wounded my poor heart and wins it still are gone if i am slow her road to seek i hope her fair and graceful name perchance to consecrate with this worn weary quill within one mortal shrine two foes had met beauty and virtueyet they dwelt so bright that ne'er within the soul did they excite rebellious thought their union might beget but parted to fulfil great nature's debt one blooms in heaven exulting in its height its twin on earth doth rest from whose veil'd night no more those eyes of love man's soul can fret that speech by heaven inspired so humbly wise that graceful airher look so winning meek that woke and kindles still my bosom's pain they all have fled but if to gain her skies i tardy seem my weary pen would seek for her blest name a consecrated reign when i look back upon the many years which in their flight my best thoughts have entomb'd and spent the fire that spite her ice consumed and finish'd the repose so full of tears broken the faith which love's young dream endears and the two parts of all my blessing doom'd this low in earth while heaven has that resumed and lost the guerdon of my pains and fears i wake and feel me to the bitter wind so bare i envy the worst lot i see selfterror and heartgrief on me so wait o death o fate o fortune stars unkind o day for ever dark and drear to me how have ye sunk me in this abject state when memory turns to gaze on time gone by which in its flight hath arm'd e'en thought with wings and to my troubled rest a period brings quells too the flame which long could ice defy and when i mark love's promise wither'd lie that treasure parted which my bosom wrings for she in heaven her shrine to nature clings whilst thus my toils' reward she doth deny i then awake and feel bereaved indeed the darkest fate on earth seems bliss to mine so much i fear myself and dread its woe o fortunedeath o star o fate decreed o bitter day that yet must sweetly shine alas too surely thou hast laid me low where is the brow whose gentlest beckonings led my raptured heart at will now here now there where the twin stars lights of this lower sphere which o'er my darkling path their radiance shed where is true worth and wit and wisdom fled the courteous phrase the melting accent where where group'd in one rich form the beauties rare which long their magic influence o'er me shed where is the shade within whose sweet recess my wearied spirit still forgot its sighs and all my thoughts their constant record found where where is she my life's sole arbitress ah wretched world and wretched ye mine eyes of her pure light bereft which aye with tears are drown'd where is that face whose slightest air could move my trembling heart and strike the springs of love that heaven where two fair stars with genial ray shed their kind influence on life's dim way where are that science sense and worth confess'd that speech by virtue by the graces dress'd where are those beauties where those charms combined that caused this long captivity of mind where the dear shade of all that once was fair the source the solace of each amorous care my heart's sole sovereign nature's only boast lost to the world to me for ever lost o earth whose claycold mantle shrouds that face and veils those eyes that late so brightly shone whence all that gave delight on earth was known how much i envy thee that harsh embrace o heaven that in thy airy courts confined that purest spirit when from earth she fled and sought the mansions of the righteous dead how envious thus to leave my panting soul behind o angels that in your seraphic choir received her sistersoul and now enjoy still present those delights without alloy which my fond heart must still in vain desire in her i livedin her my life decays yet envious fate denies to end my hapless days what envy of the greedy earth i bear that holds from me within its cold embrace the light the meaning of that angel face on which to gaze could soften e'en despair what envy of the saints in realms so fair who eager seem'd from that bright form of grace the spirit pure to summon to its place amidst those joys which few can hope to share what envy of the blest in heaven above with whom she dwells in sympathies divine denied to me on earth though sought in sighs and oh what envy of stern death i prove that with her life has ta'en the light of mine yet calls me notthough fixed and cold those eyes valley which long hast echoed with my cries stream which my flowing tears have often fed beasts fluttering birds and ye who in the bed of cabrieres' wave display your speckled dyes air hush'd to rest and soften'd by my sighs dear path whose mazes lone and sad i tread hill of delightthough now delight is fled to rove whose haunts love still my foot decoys well i retain your old unchanging face myself how changed in whom for joy's light throng infinite woes their constant mansion find here bloom'd my bliss and i your tracks retrace to mark whence upward to her heaven she sprung leaving her beauteous spoil her robe of flesh behind ye vales made vocal by my plaintive lay ye streams embitter'd with the tears of love ye tenants of the sweet melodious grove ye tribes that in the grass fringed streamlet play ye tepid gales to which my sighs convey a softer warmth ye flowery plains that move reflection sad ye hills where yet i rove since laura there first taught my steps to stray you you are still the same how changed alas am i who from a state of life so blest am now the gloomy dwellingplace of woe 'twas here i saw my love here still i trace her parting steps when she her mortal vest cast to the earth and left these scenes below fond fancy raised me to the spot where strays she whom i seek but find on earth no more there fairer still and humbler than before i saw her in the third heaven's blessèd maze she took me by the hand and thou shalt trace if hope not errs she said this happy shore i i am she thy breast with slights who tore and ere its evening closed my day's brief space what human heart conceives my joys exceed thee only i expect and what remain below the charms once objects of thy love why ceased she ah my captive hand why freed such of her soft and hallow'd tones the chain from that delightful heaven my soul could scarcely move thither my ecstatic thought had rapt me where she dwells whom still on earth i seek in vain and there with those whom the third heavens contain i saw her much more kind and much more fair my hand she took and said within this sphere if hope deceive me not thou shalt again with me reside who caused thy mortal pain am i and even in summer closed my year my bliss no human thought can understand thee only i await and that erewhile you held so dear the veil i left behind she ceasedah why why did she loose my hand for oh her hallow'd words her roseate smile in heaven had well nigh fix'd my ravish'd mind love that in happier days wouldst meet me here along these meads that nursed our kindred strains and that old debt to clear which still remains sweet converse with the stream and me wouldst share ye flowers leaves grass woods grots rills gentle air low valleys lofty hills and sunny plains the harbour where i stored my lovesick pains and all my various chance my racking care ye playful inmates of the greenwood shade ye nymphs and ye that in the waves pursue that life its cool and grassy bottom lends my days were once so fair now dark and dread as death that makes them so thus the world through on each as soon as born his fate attends on these green banks in happier days i stray'd with love who whisper'd many a tender tale and the glad waters winding through the dale heard the sweet eloquence fond love display'd you purpled plain cool grot and arching glade ye hills ye streams where plays the silken gale ye pathless wilds you rockencircled vale which oft have beard the tender plaints i made ye bluehair'd nymphs who ceaseless revel keep in the cool bosom of the crystal deep ye woodland maids who climb the mountain's brow ye mark'd how joy once wing'd each hour so gay ah mark how sad each hour now wears away so fate with human bliss blends human woe while on my heart the worms consuming prey'd of love and i with all his fire was caught the steps of my fair wild one still i sought to trace o'er desert mountains as she stray'd and much i dared in bitter strains to upbraid both love and her whom i so cruel thought but rude was then my genius and untaught my rhymes while weak and new the ideas play'd dead is that fire and cold its ashes lie in one small tomb which had it still grown on e'en to old age as oft by others felt arm'd with the power of rhyme which wretched i e'en now disclaim my riper strains had won e'en stones to burst and in soft sorrows melt bright spirit from those earthly bonds released the loveliest ever wove in nature's loom from thy bright skies compassionate the gloom shrouding my life that once of joy could taste each false suggestion of thy heart has ceased that whilom bade thee stem disdain assume now all secure heaven's habitant become list to my sighs thy looks upon me cast mark the huge rock whence sorga's waters rise and see amidst its waves and borders stray one fed by grief and memory that ne'er dies but from that spot oh turn thy sight away where i first loved where thy late dwelling lies that in thy friends thou nought ungrateful may'st survey blest soul that loosen'd from those bands art flown bands than which nature never form'd more fair look down and mark how changed to carking care from gladdest thoughts i pass my days unknown each false opinion from my heart is gone that once to me made thy sweet sight appear most harsh and bitter now secure from fear here turn thine eyes and listen to my moan turn to this rock whence sorga's waters rise and mark where through the mead its waters flow one who of thee still mindful ceaseless sighs but leave me there unsought for where to glow our flames began and where thy mansion lies lest thou in thine shouldst see what grieved thee so that sun which ever signall'd the right road where flash'd her own bright feet to heaven to fly returning to the eternal sun on high has quench'd my light and cast her earthly load thus lone and weary my oft steps have trode as some wild animal the sere woods by fleeing with heavy heart and downcast eye the world which since to me a blank has show'd still with fond search each wellknown spot i pace where once i saw her love who grieves me so my only guide directs me where to go i find her not her every sainted trace seeks in bright realms above her parent star from grisly styx and black avernus far i thought me apt and firm of wing to rise not of myself but him who trains us all in song to numbers fitting the fair thrall which love once fasten'd and which death unties slow now and frail the task too sorely tries as a great weight upon a sucker small who leaps i said too high may midway fall man ill accomplishes what heaven denies so far the wing of genius ne'er could fly poor style like mine and faltering tongue much less as nature rose in that rare fabric high love follow'd nature with such full success in gracing her no claim could i advance even to look and yet was bless'd by chance she for whose sake fair arno i resign and for free poverty courtaffluence spurn has known to sour the precious sweets to turn on which i lived for which i burn and pine though since the vain attempt has oft been mine that future ages from my song should learn her heavenly beauties and like me should burn my poor verse fails her sweet face to define the gifts though all her own which others share which were but stars her bright sky scatter'd o'er haply of these to sing e'en i might dare but when to the diviner part i soar to the dull world a brief and brilliant light courage and wit and art are baffled quite the wonder high and new that in our days dawn'd on the world yet would not there remain which heaven but show'd to us to snatch again better to blazon its own starry ways that to far times i her should paint and praise love wills who prompted first my passionate strain but now wit leisure pen page ink in vain to the fond task a thousand times he sways my slow rhymes struggle not to life the while i feel it and whoe'er today below or speak or write of love will prove it so who justly deems the truth beyond all style here silent let him muse and sighing say blessèd the eyes who saw her living day zephyr returns and in his jocund train brings verdure flowers and days serenely clear brings progne's twitter philomel's lorn strain with every bloom that paints the vernal year cloudless the skies and smiling every plain with joyance flush'd jove views his daughter dear love's genial power pervades earth air and main all beings join'd in fond accord appear but nought to me returns save sorrowing sighs forced from my inmost heart by her who bore those keys which govern'd it unto the skies the blossom'd meads the choristers of air sweet courteous damsels can delight no more each face looks savage and each prospect drear the spring returns with all her smiling train the wanton zephyrs breathe along the bowers the glistening dewdrops hang on bending flowers and tender green lightshadows o'er the plain and thou sweet philomel renew'st thy strain breathing thy wild notes to the midnight grove all nature feels the kindling fire of love the vital force of spring's returning reign but not to me returns the cheerful spring o heart that know'st no period to thy grief nor nature's smiles to thee impart relief nor change of mind the varying seasons bring she she is gone all that e'er pleased before adieu ye birds ye flowers ye fields that charm no more returning zephyr the sweet season brings with flowers and herbs his breathing train among and progne twitters philomela sings leading the manycolour'd spring along serene the sky and fair the laughing field jove views his daughter with complacent brow earth sea and air to love's sweet influence yield and creatures all his magic power avow but nought alas for me the season brings save heavier sighs from my sad bosom drawn by her who can from heaven unlock its springs and warbling birds and flowerbespangled lawn and fairest acts of ladies fair and mild a desert seem and its brute tenants wild zephyr returns and winter's rage restrains with herbs with flowers his blooming progeny now progne prattles philomel complains and spring assumes her robe of various dye the meadows smile heaven glows nor jove disdains to view his daughter with delighted eye while love through universal nature reigns and life is fill'd with amorous sympathy but grief not joy returns to me forlorn and sighs which from my inmost heart proceed for her by whom to heaven its keys were borne the song of birds the flowerenamell'd mead and graceful acts which most the fair adorn a desert seem and beasts of savage prey yon nightingale whose bursts of thrilling tone pour'd in soft sorrow from her tuneful throat haply her mate or infant brood bemoan filling the fields and skies with pity's note here lingering till the long long night is gone awakes the memory of my cruel lot but i my wretched self must wail alone fool who secure from death an angel thought o easy duped who thus on hope relies who would have deem'd the darkness which appears from orbs more brilliant than the sun should rise now know i made by sad experience wise that fate would teach me by a life of tears on wings how fleeting fast all earthly rapture flies yon nightingale whose strain so sweetly flows mourning her ravish'd young or muchloved mate a soothing charm o'er all the valleys throws and skies with notes well tuned to her sad state and all the night she seems my kindred woes with me to weep and on my sorrows wait sorrows that from my own fond fancy rose who deem'd a goddess could not yield to fate how easy to deceive who sleeps secure who could have thought that to dull earth would turn those eyes that as the sun shone bright and pure ah now what fortune wills i see full sure that loathing life yet living i should see how few its joys how little they endure that nightingale who now melodious mourns perhaps his children or his consort dear the heavens with sweetness fills the distant bourns resound his notes so piteous and so clear with me all night he weeps and seems by turns to upbraid me with my fault and fortune drear whose fond and foolish heart where grief sojourns a goddess deem'd exempt from mortal fear security how easy to betray the radiance of those eyes who could have thought should e'er become a senseless clod of clay living and weeping late i've learn'd to say that here belowoh knowledge dearly bought whate'er delights will scarcely last a day not skies serene with glittering stars inlaid nor gallant ships o'er tranquil ocean dancing nor gay careering knights in arms advancing nor wild herds bounding through the forest glade nor tidings new of happiness delay'd nor poesie love's witchery enhancing nor lady's song beside clear fountain glancing in beauty's pride with chastity array'd nor aught of lovely aught of gay in show shall touch my heart now cold within her tomb who was erewhile my life and light below so heavytedioussadmy days unblest that i with strong desire invoke death's gloom her to behold whom ne'er to have seen were best nor stars bright glittering through the cool still air nor proud ships riding on the tranquil main nor armed knights light pricking o'er the plain nor deer in glades disporting void of care nor tidings hoped by recent messenger nor tales of love in high and gorgeous strain nor by clear stream green mead or shady lane sweetchaunted roundelay of lady fair nor aught beside my heart shall e'er engage sepulchred as 'tis henceforth doom'd to be with her my eyes' sole mirror beam and bliss oh how i long this weary pilgrimage to close that i again that form may see which never to have seen had been my happiness fledfled alas for everis the day which to my flame some soothing whilom brought and fled is she of whom i wept and wrote yet still the pang the tear prolong their stay and fled that angel vision far away but flying with soft glance my heart it smote 'twas then my own which straight divided sought her who had wrapp'd it in her robe of clay part shares her tomb part to her heaven is sped where now with laurel wreathed in triumph's car she reaps the meed of matchless holiness so might i of this flesh discumberèd which holds me prisoner here from sorrow far with her expatiate free 'midst realms of endless bliss ah gone for ever are the happy years that soothed my soul amid love's fiercest fire and she for whom i wept and tuned my lyre has gone alasbut left my lyre my tears gone is that face whose holy look endears but in my heart ere yet it did retire left the sweet radiance of its eyes entire my heart ah no not mine for to the spheres of light she bore it captive soaring high in angel robe triumphant and now stands crown'd with the laurel wreath of chastity oh could i throw aside these earthly bands that tie me down where wretched mortals sigh to join blest spirits in celestial lands my mind prophetic of my coming fate pensive and gloomy while yet joy was lent on the loved lineaments still fix'd intent to seek dark bodings ere thy sorrow's date from her sweet acts her words her looks her gait from her unwonted pity with sadness blent thou might'st have said hadst thou been prescient i taste my last of bliss in this low state my wretched soul the poison oh how sweet that through my eyes instill'd the burning smart gazing on hers no more on earth to meet to themmy bosom's wealth condemn'd to part on a far journeyas to friends discreet all my fond thoughts i left and lingering heart all my green years and golden prime of man had pass'd away and with attemper'd sighs my bosom heavedere yet the days arise when life declines contracting its brief span already my loved enemy began to lull suspicion and in sportive guise with timid confidence though playful wise in gentle mockery my long pains to scan the hour was near when love at length may mate with chastity and by the dear one's side the lover's thoughts and words may freely flow death saw with envy my too happy state e'en its fair promiseand with fatal pride strode in the midway forth an armèd foe now of my life each gay and greener year pass'd by and cooler grew each hour the flame with which i burn'd and to that point we came whence life descends as to its end more near now 'gan my lovely foe each virtuous fear gently to lay aside as safe from blame and though with saintlike virtue still the same mock'd my sweet pains indeed but deign'd to hear nigh drew the time when love delights to dwell with chastity and lovers with their mate can fearless sit and all they muse of tell death envied me the joys of such a state nay e'en the hopes i form'd and on them fell e'en in midway like some arm'd foe in wait 'twas time at last from so long war to find some peace or truce and haply both were nigh but death their welcome feet has turn'd behind who levels all distinctions low as high and as a cloud dissolves before the wind so she who led me with her lustrous eye whom ever i pursue with faithful mind her fair life briefly ending sought the sky had she but stay'd as i grew changed and old her tone had changed and no distrust had been to parley with me on my cherish'd ill with what frank sighs and fond i then had told my lifelong toils which now from heaven i ween she sees and with me sympathises still my life's long warfare seem'd about to cease peace had my spirit's contest well nigh freed but levelling death who doth to all concede an equal doom clipp'd time's blest wings of peace as zephyrs chase the clouds of gathering fleece so did her life from this world's breath recede their vision'd light could once my footsteps lead but now my all save thought she doth release oh would that she her flight awhile had stay'd for time had stamp'd on me his warning hand and calmer i had told my storied love to her in virtue's tone i had convey'd my heart's long griefnow she doth understand and sympathises with that grief above from life's long storm of trouble and of tears love show'd a tranquil haven and fair end 'mid better thoughts which riper age attend that vice lays bare and virtue clothes and cheers she saw my true heart free from doubts and fears and its high faith which could no more offend ah cruel death how quick wert thou to rend in so few hours the fruit of many years a longer life the time had surely brought when in her chaste ear my full heart had laid the ancient burthen of its dearest thought and she perchance might then have answer made forthsighing some blest words whilst white and few our locks became and wan our cheeks in hue as a fair plant uprooted by oft blows of trenchant spade or which the blast upheaves scatters on earth its green and lofty leaves and its bare roots to the broad sunlight shows love such another for my object chose of whom for me the muse a subject weaves who in my captured heart her home achieves as on some wall or tree the ivy grows that living laurelwhere their chosen nest my high thoughts made where sigh'd mine ardent grief yet never stirr'd of its fair boughs a leaf to heaven translated in my heart her rest left deep its roots whence ever with sad cry i call on her who ne'er vouchsafes reply my days more swiftly than the forest hind have fled like shadows and no pleasure seen save for a moment and few hours serene whose bittersweet i treasure in true mind o wretched world unstable wayward blind whose hopes in thee alone have centred been in thee my heart was captived by her mien who bore it with her when she earth rejoin'd her better spirit now a deathless flower and in the highest heaven that still shall be each day inflames me with its beauties more alone though frailer fonder every hour i muse on hernow what and where is she and what the lovely veil which here she wore oh swifter than the hart my life hath fled a shadow'd dream one winged glance hath seen its only good its hours how few serene the sweet and bitter tide of thought have fed ephemeral world in pride and sorrow bred who hope in thee are blind as i have been i hoped in thee and thus my heart's loved queen hath borne it mid her nerveless kindred dead her form decay'dits beauty still survives for in high heaven that soul will ever bloom with which each day i more enamour'd grow thus though my locks are blanch'd my hope revives in thinking on her homeher soul's high doom alas how changed the shrine she left below i feel the wellknown gale the hills i spy so pleasant whence my fair her being drew which made these eyes while heaven was willing shew wishful and gay now sad and never dry o feeble hopes o thoughts of vanity wither'd the grass the rills of turbid hue and void and cheerless is that dwelling too in which i live in which i wish'd to die hoping its mistress might at length afford some respite to my woes by plaintive sighs and sorrows pour'd from her onceburning eyes i've served a cruel and ungrateful lord while lived my beauteous flame my heart be fired and o'er its ashes now i weep expired once more ye balmy gales i feel you blow again sweet hills i mark the morning beams gild your green summits while your silver streams through vales of fragrance undulating flow but you ye dreams of bliss no longer here give life and beauty to the glowing scene for stern remembrance stands where you have been and blasts the verdure of the blooming year o laura laura in the dust with thee would i could find a refuge from despair is this thy boasted triumph love to tear a heart thy coward malice dares not free and bid it live while every hope is fled to weep among the ashes of the dead is this the nest in which my phoenix first her plumage donn'd of purple and of gold beneath her wings who knew my heart to hold for whom e'en yet its sighs and wishes burst prime root in which my cherish'd ill had birth where is the fair face whence that bright light came alive and glad which kept me in my flame now bless'd in heaven as then alone on earth wretched and lonely thou hast left me here fond lingering by the scenes with sorrows drown'd to thee which consecrate i still revere watching the hills as dark night gathers round whence its last flight to heaven thy soul did take and where my day those bright eyes wont to make is this the nest in which her wings of gold of gold and purple plume my phoenix laid how flutter'd my fond heart beneath their shade but now its sighs proclaim that dwelling cold sweet source from which my bliss my bane have roll'd where is that face in living light array'd that burn'd me yet my sole enjoyment made unparallel'd on earth the heavens now hold thee bless'dbut i am left wretched alone yet ever in my grief return to see and honour this sweet place though thou art gone a black night veils the hills whence rising free thou took'st thy heavenward flight ah when they shone in morning radiance it was all from thee ne'er shall i see again with eyes unwet or with the sure powers of a tranquil mind those characters where love so brightly shined and his own hand affection seem'd to set spirit amid earth's strifes unconquer'd yet breathing such sweets from heaven which now has shrined as once more to my wandering verse has join'd the style which death had led me to forget another work than my young leaves more bright i thought to show what envying evil star snatch'd thee my noble treasure thus from me so soon who hides thee from my fond heart's sight and from thy praise my loving tongue would bar my soul has rest sweet sigh alone in thee oh ne'er shall i behold with tearless eye or tranquil soul those characters of thine in which affection doth so brightly shine and charity's own hand i can descry blest soul that could this earthly strife defy thy sweets instilling from thy home divine thou wakest in me the tone which once was mine to sing my rhymes death's power did long deny with these my brow's young leaves i fondly dream'd another work than this had greeted thee what iron planet envied thus our love my treasure veil'd ere age had darkly gleam'd thouwhom my song recordsmy heart doth see thou wakest my sigh and sighing rest i prove while at my window late i stood alone so new and many things there cross'd my sight to view them i had almost weary grown a dappled hind appear'd upon the right in aspect gentle yet of stately stride by two swift greyhounds chased a black and white who tore in the poor side of that fair creature wounds so deep and wide that soon they forced her where ravine and rock the onward passage block then triumph'd death her matchless beauties o'er and left me lonely there her sad fate to deplore upon the summer wave a gay ship danced her cordage was of silk of gold her sails her sides with ivory and ebon glanced the sea was tranquil favouring were the gales and heaven as when no cloud its azure veils a rich and goodly merchandise is hers but soon the tempest wakes and wind and wave to such mad fury stirs that driven on the rocks in twain she breaks my heart with pity aches that a short hour should whelm a small space hide riches for which the world no equal had beside in a fair grove a bright young laurel made surely to paradise the plant belongs of sacred boughs a pleasant summer shade from whose green depths there issued so sweet songs of various birds and many a rare delight of eye and ear what marvel from the world they stole my senses quite while still i gazed the heavens grew black around the fatal lightning flash'd and sudden hurl'd uprooted to the ground that blessed birth alas for it laid low and its dear shade whose like we ne'er again shall know a crystal fountain in that very grove gush'd from a rock whose waters fresh and clear shed coolness round and softly murmur'd love never that leafy screen and mossy seat drew browsing flock or whistling rustic near but nymphs and muses danced to music sweet there as i sat and drank with infinite delight their carols gay and mark'd their sport the earth before me sank and bore with it away the fountain and the scene to my great grief who now in memory find a sole and scant relief a lovely and rare bird within the wood whose crest with gold whose wings with purple gleam'd alone but proudly soaring next i view'd of heavenly and immortal birth which seem'd flitting now here now there until it stood where buried fount and broken laurel lay and sadly seeing there the fallen trunk the boughs all stripp'd and bare the channel driedfor all things to decay so tendit turn'd away as if in angry scorn and instant fled while through me for her loss new love and pity spread at length along the flowery sward i saw so sweet and fair a lady pensive move that her mere thought inspires a tender awe meek in herself but haughty against love flow'd from her waist a robe so fair and fine seem'd gold and snow together there to join but ah each charm above was veil'd from sight in an unfriendly cloud stung by a lurking snake as flowers that pine her head she gently bow'd and joyful pass'd on high perchance secure alas that in the world grief only should endure my song in each sad change these visions as they rise sweet solemn strange but show how deeply in thy master's breast the fond desire abides to die and be at rest yes love at that propitious time when hope was in its bloomy prime and when i vainly fancied nigh the meed of all my constancy then sudden she of whom i sought compassion from my sight was caught o ruthless death o life severe the one has sunk me deep in care and darken'd cruelly my day that shone with hope's enlivening ray the other adverse to my will doth here on earth detain me still and interdicts me to pursue her who from all its scenes withdrew yet in my heart resides the fair for ever ever present there who well perceives the ills that wait upon my wretched mortal state yes love while hope still bloom'd with me in pride while seem'd of all my faith the guerdon nigh she upon whom for mercy i relied was ravish'd from my doting desolate eye o ruthless death o life unwelcome this plunged me in deepest woe and rudely crush'd my every hope of bliss against my will that keeps me here below who else would yearn to go and join the sainted fair who left us late yet present every hour in my heart's core there wields she her old power and knows whate'er my life its every state fain would i speaktoo long has silence seal'd lips that would gladly with my full heart move with one consent and yield homage to her who listens from above yet how can i without thy prompting love with mortal words e'er equal things divine and picture faithfully the high humility whose chosen shrine was that fair prison whence she now is free which held erewhile her gentle spirit when so in my conscious heart her power began that instantly i ran alike o' th' year and me 'twas april then from these gay meadows round sweet flowers to bind hoping rich pleasure at her eyes to find the walls were alabaster the roof gold ivory the doors the sapphire windows lent whence on my heart of old its earliest sigh as shall my last was sent in arrowy jets of fire thence came and went arm'd messengers of love whereof to think as then they were with awe though now for them with laurel crown'di shrink of one rare diamond square without a flaw high in the midst a stately throne was placed where sat the lovely lady all alone in front a column shone of crystal and thereon each thought was traced in characters so clear and quick and true by turns it gladden'd me and grieved to view to weapons such as these sharp burning bright to the green glorious banner waved above 'gainst which would fail in fight mars polypheme apollo mighty jove while still my sorrow fresh and verdant throve i stood defenceless doom'd her easy prey she led me as she chose whence to escape i knew nor art nor way but as a friend who haply grieves yet goes sees something still to lure his eyes and heart just so on her for whom i am in thrall sole perfect work of all that graced her age unable to depart with such desire my rapt regards i set as soon myself and misery to forget on earth myself my heart in eden dwelt lost in sweet lethe every other care as my live frame i felt to marble turn watching that wonder rare when old in years but youthful still in air a lady briefly quietly drew nigh and thus beholding me with reverent aspect and admiring eye kind offer made my counsellor to be my power she said is more than mortals know lighter than air i in an instant make their hearts exult or ache i loose and bind whate'er is seen below thine eyes upon that sun as eagles' bend but to my words with willing ears attend the day when she was born the stars that win prosperity for man shone bright above their high glad homes within each on the other smiled with gratulant love fair venus and with gentle aspect jove the beautiful and lordly mansions held seem'd as each adverse light throughout all heaven was darken'd and dispell'd the sun ne'er look'd upon a day so bright the air and earth rejoiced the waves had rest by lake and river and o'er ocean green 'mid the enchanting scene one distant cloud alone my thought distress'd lest sometime it might be of tears the source unless kind heaven should elsewhere turn its course when first she enter'd on this life below which to say sooth not worthy was to hold 'twas strange to see her so angelical and dear in baby mould a snowy pearl she seem'd in finest gold next as she crawl'd or totter'd with short pace wood water earth and stone grew green and clear and soft with livelier grace the sward beneath her feet and fingers shone with flowers the champain to her bright eyes smiled at her sweet voice babbling through lips that yet from love's own fount were wet the hoarse wind silent grew the tempest mild thus clearly showing to the dull blind world how much in her was heaven's own light unfurl'd at length her life's third flowery epoch won she year by year so grew in charms and worth that ne'er methinks the sun such gracefulness and beauty saw on earth her eyes so full of modesty and mirth music and welcome on her words so hung that mute in her high praise which thine alone may sound is every tongue so bright her countenance with heavenly rays not long thy dazzled vision there may rest from this her fair and fleshly tenement such fire through thine is sent though gentler never kindled human breast that yet i fear her sudden flight may be too soon the cause of bitter grief to thee this said she turn'd her to the rapid wheel whereon she winds of mortal life the thread too true did she reveal the doom of woe which darken'd o'er my head a few brief years flew by when she for whom i so desire to die by black and pitiless death who could not slay a fairer form than hers was snatch'd away now hast thou shown fell death thine utmost might through love's bright realm hast want and darkness spread hast now cropp'd beauty's flower its heavenly light quench'd and enclosed in the grave's narrow bed now hast thou life despoil'd of all delight its ornament and sovereign honour shed but fame and worth it is not thine to blight these mock thy power and sleep not with the dead be thine the mortal part heaven holds the best and glorying in its brightness brighter glows while memory still records the great and good o thou in thine high triumph angel blest let thy heart yield to pity of my woes e'en as thy beauty here my soul subdued now hast thou shown the utmost of thy might o cruel death love's kingdom hast thou rent and made it poor in narrow grave hast pent the blooming flower of beauty and its light our wretched life thou hast despoil'd outright of every honour every ornament but then her fame her worth by thee unblent shall still surviveher dust is all thy right the rest heaven holds proud of her charms divine as of a brighter sun nor dies she here her memory lasts to good men ever dear o angel new in thy celestial sphere let pity now thy sainted heart incline as here below thy beauty vanquish'd mine the air and scent the comfort and the shade of my sweet laurel and its flowery sight that to my weary life gave rest and light death spoiler of the world has lowly laid as when the moon our sun's eclipse has made my lofty light has vanish'd so in night for aid against himself i death invite with thoughts so dark does love my breast invade thou didst but sleep bright lady a brief sleep in bliss amid the chosen spirits to wake who gaze upon their god distinct and near and if my verse shall any value keep preserved and praised 'mid noble minds to make thy name its memory shall be deathless here the fragrant gale and the refreshing shade of my sweet laurel and its verdant form that were my shelter in life's weary storm have felt the power that makes all nature fade now has my light been lost in gloomy shade e'en as the sun behind his sister's form i call for death to free me from death's storm but love descends and brings me better aid he tells me lady that one moment's sleep alone was thine and then thou didst awake among the elect and in thy maker's arms and if my verse oblivion's power can keep aloof thy name its place on earthwill take where genius still will dote upon thy charms the last alas of my bright days and glad few have been mine in this brief life below had come i felt my heart as tepid snow presage perchance of days both dark and sad as one in nerves and pulse and spirits bad who of some frequent fever waits the blow e'en so i feltfor how could i foreknow such near end of the halfjoys i have had her beauteous eyes in heaven now bright and bless'd with the pure light whence health and life descends wretched and beggar'd leaving me behind with chaste and soullit beams our grief address'd tarry ye here in peace beloved friends though here no more we yet shall there be join'd ah me the last of all my happy days not many happy days my years can show was come i felt my heart as turn'd to snow presage perhaps that happiness decays e'en as the man whose shivering frame betrays and fluttering pulse the ague's coming blow 'twas thus i feltbut could i therefore know how soon would end the bliss that never stays those eyes that now in heaven's delicious light drink in pure beams which life and glory rain just as they left mine blinded sunk in night seem'd thus to say sparkling unwonted bright awhile beloved friends in peace remain oh we shall yet elsewhere exchange fond looks again o day o hour o moment sweetest last o stars conspired to make me poor indeed o look too true in which i seem'd to read at parting that my happiness was past now my full loss i know i feel at last then i believed ah weak and idle creed 'twas but a part alone i lost instead was there a hope that flew not with the blast for even then it was in heaven ordain'd that the sweet light of all my life should die 'twas written in her sadlypensive eye but mine unconscious of the truth remain'd or what it would not see to see refrain'd that i might sink in sudden misery dark hour last moment of that fatal day stars which to beggar me of bliss combined o faithful glance too well which seem'dst to say farewell to me farewell to peace of mind awaken'd now my losses i survey alas i fondly thoughtthoughts weak and blind that absence would take part not all away how many hopes it scatter'd to the wind heaven had already doom'd it otherwise to quench for ever my life's genial light and in her sad sweet face 'twas written so surely a veil was placed around mine eyes that blinded me to all before my sight and sank at once my life in deepest woe that glance of hers pure tender clear and sweet methought it said take what thou canst while nigh for here no more thou'lt see me till on high from earth have mounted thy slowmoving feet o intellect than forest pard more fleet yet slow and dull thy sorrow to descry how didst thou fail to see in her bright eye what since befell whence i my ruin meet silently shining with a fire sublime they said o friendly lights which long have been mirrors to us where gladly we were seen heaven waits for you as ye shall know in time who bound us to the earth dissolves our bond but wills in your despite that you shall live beyond i who was wont from life's best fountain far so long to wander searching land and sea pursuing not my pleasure but my star and alway as love knows who strengthen'd me ready in bitter exile to depart for hope and memory both then fed my heart alas now wring my hands and to unkind and angry fortune which away has reft that so sweet hope my armour have resign'd and memory only left i feed my great desire on that alone whence frail and famish'd is my spirit grown as haply by the way if want of food compel the traveller to relax his speed losing that strength which first his steps endued so feeling for my weary life the need of that dear nourishment death rudely stole leaving the world all bare and sad my soul from time to time fair pleasures pall my sweet to bitter turns fear rises and hopes fail my course though brief that i shall e'er complete cloudlike before the gale to win some restingplace from rest i flee if such indeed my doom so let it be never to mortal life could i incline be witness love with whom i parley oft except for her who was its light and mine and since below extinguish'd shines aloft the life in which i lived if lawful 'twere my chief desire would be to follow her but mine is ample cause of grief for i to see my future fate was ill supplied this love reveal'd within her beauteous eye elsewhere my hopes to guide too late he dies disconsolate and sad whom death a little earlier had made glad in those bright eyes where wont my heart to dwell until by envy my hard fortune stirr'd rose from so rich a temple to expel love with his proper hand had character'd in lines of pity what ere long i ween the issue of my old desire had been dying alone and not my life with me comely and sweet it then had been to die leaving my life's best part unscathed and free but now my fond hopes lie dead in her silent dust a secret chill shoots through me when i think that i live still if my poor intellect had but the force to help my need and if no other lure had led it from the plain and proper course upon my lady's brow 'twere easy sure to have read this truth here all thy pleasure dies and hence thy lifelong trial dates its rise my spirit then had gently pass'd away in her dear presence from all mortal care freed from this troublesome and heavy clay mounting before her where angels and saints prepared on high her place whom i but follow now with slow sad pace my song if one there be who in his love finds happiness and rest tell him this truth from me die while thou still art bless'd for death betimes is comfort not dismay and who can rightly die needs no delay my favouring fortune and my life of joy my days so cloudless and my tranquil nights the tender sigh the pleasing power of song which gently wont to sound in verse and rhyme suddenly darken'd into grief and tears make me hate life and inly pray for death o cruel grim inexorable death how hast thou dried my every source of joy and left me to drag on a life of tears through darkling days and melancholy nights my heavy sighs no longer meet in rhyme and my hard martyrdom exceeds all song where now is vanish'd my once amorous song to talk of anger and to treat with death where the fond verses where the happy rhyme welcomed by gentle hearts with pensive joy where now love's communings that cheer'd my nights my sole theme my one thought is now but tears erewhile to my desire so sweet were tears their tenderness refined my else rude song and made me wake and watch the livelong nights but sorrow now to me is worse than death since lost for aye that look of modest joy the lofty subject of my lowly rhyme love in those bright eyes to my ready rhyme gave a fair theme now changed alas to tears with grief remembering that time of joy my changed thoughts issue find in other song evermore thee beseeching pallid death to snatch and save me from these painful nights sleep has departed from my anguish'd nights music is absent from my rugged rhyme which knows not now to sound of aught but death its notes so thrilling once all turn'd to tears love knows not in his reign such varied song as full of sadness now as then of joy man lived not then so crown'd as i with joy man lives not now such wretched days and nights and my full festering grief but swells the song which from my bosom draws the mournful rhyme i lived in hope who now live but in tears nor against death have other hope save death me death in her has kill'd and only death can to my sight restore that face of joy which pleasant made to me e'en sighs and tears balmy the air and dewy soft the nights wherein my choicest thoughts i gave to rhyme while love inspirited my feeble song would that such power as erst graced orpheus' song were mine to win my laura back from death as he eurydice without a rhyme then would i live in best excess of joy or that denied me soon may some sad night close for me ever these twin founts of tears love i have told with late and early tears my grievous injuries in doleful song not that i hope from thee less cruel nights and therefore am i urged to pray for death which hence would take me but to crown with joy where lives she whom i sing in this sad rhyme if so high may aspire my weary rhyme to her now shelter'd safe from rage and tears whose beauties fill e'en heaven with livelier joy well would she recognise my alter'd song which haply pleased her once ere yet by death her days were cloudless made and dark my nights o ye who fondly sigh for better nights who listen to love's will or sing in rhyme pray that for me be no delay in death the port of misery the goal of tears but let him change for me his ancient song since what makes others sad fills me with joy ay for such joy in one or in few nights i pray in rude song and in anguish'd rhyme that soon my tears may ended be in death go plaintive verse to the cold marble go which hides in earth my treasure from these eyes there call on her who answers from yon skies although the mortal part dwells dark and low of life how i am wearied make her know of stemming these dread waves that round me rise but copying all her virtues i so prize her track i follow yet my steps are slow i sing of her living or dead alone dead did i say she is immortal made that by the world she should be loved and known oh in my passage hence may she be near to greet my coming that's not long delay'd and may i hold in heaven the rank herself holds there go melancholy rhymes your tribute bring to that cold stone which holds the dear remains of all that earth held preciousuttering if heaven should deign to hear them earthly strains tell her that sport of tempests fit no more to stem the troublous oceanhere at last her votary treads the solitary shore his only pleasure to recall the past tell her that she who living ruled his fate in death still holds her empire all his care so grant the muse her aidto celebrate her every word and thought and action fair be this my meed that in the hour of death her kindred spirit may hail and bless my parting breath if mercy e'er rewardeth virtuous love if pity still can do as she has done i shall have rest for clearer than the sun my lady and the world my faith approve who fear'd me once now knows yet scarce believes i am the same who wont her love to seek who seek it still where she but heard me speak or saw my face she now my soul perceives wherefore i hope that e'en in heaven she mourns my heavy anguish and on me the while her sweet face eloquent of pity turns and that when shuffled off this mortal coil her way to me with that fair band she'll wend true follower of christ and virtue's friend if virtuous love doth merit recompense if pity still maintain its wonted sway i that reward shall win for bright as day to earth and laura breathes my faith's incense she fear'd me oncenow heavenly confidence reveals my heart's first hope's unchanging stay a word a look could this alone convey my heart she reads now stripp'd of earth's defence and thus i hope she for my heavy sighs to heaven complains to me she pity shows by sympathetic visits in my dream and when this mortal temple breathless lies oh may she greet my soul enclosed by those whom heaven and virtue loveour friends supreme 'mid many fair one such by me was seen that amorous fears my heart did instant seize beholding hernor false the images equal to angels in her heavenly mien nothing in her was mortal or terrene as one whom nothing short of heaven can please my soul well train'd for her to burn and freeze sought in her wake to mount the blue serene but ah too high for earthly wings to rise her pitch and soon she wholly pass'd from sight the very thought still makes me cold and numb o beautiful and high and lustrous eyes where death who fills the world with grief and fright found entrance in so fair a form to come oh to my soul for ever she returns or rather lethe could not blot her thence such as she was when first she struck my sense in that bright blushing age when beauty burns so still i see her bashful as she turns retired into herself as from offence i cry'tis she she still has life and sense oh speak to me my lovesometimes she spurns my call sometimes she seems to answer straight then starting from my waking dream i say alas poor wretch thou art of mind bereft forget'st thou the first hour of the sixth day of april the three hundred forty eight and thousandth yearwhen she her earthly mansion left my mind recalls her nay her home is there nor can lethean draught drive thence her form i see that star's pure ray her spirit warm whose grace and springtime beauty she doth wear as thus my vision paints her charms so rare that none to such perfection may conform i cry 'tis she death doth to life transform and then to hear that voice i wake my prayer she now replies and now doth mute appear like one whose tottering mind regains its power i speak my heart thou must this cheat resign the thirteen hundred eight and fortieth year the sixth of april's suns his first bright hour thou know'st that soul celestial fled its shrine this gift of beauty which a good men name frail fleeting fancied false a wind a shade ne'er yet with all its spells one fair array'd save in this age when for my cost it came not such is nature's duty nor her aim one to enrich if others poor are made but now on one is all her wealth display'd ladies your pardon let my boldness claim like loveliness ne'er lived or old or new nor ever shall i ween but hid so strange scarce did our erring world its marvel view so soon it fled thus too my soul must change the little light vouchsafed me from the skies only for pleasure of her sainted eyes o time o heavens whose flying changes frame errors and snares for mortals poor and blind o days more swift than arrows or the wind experienced now i know your treacherous aim you i excuse myself alone i blame for nature for your flight who wings design'd to me gave eyes which still i have inclined to mine own ill whence follow grief and shame an hour will come haply e'en now is pass'd their sight to turn on my diviner part and so this infinite anguish end at last rejects not your long yoke o love my heart but its own ill by study sufferings vast virtue is not of chance but painful art o time o circling heavens in your flight us mortals ye deceiveso poor and blind o days more fleeting than the shaft or wind experience brings your treachery to my sight but mine the errorye yourselves are right your flight fulfils but that your wings design'd my eyes were nature's gift yet ne'er could find but one blest lightand hence their present blight it now is time perchance the hour is pass'd that they a safer dwelling should select and thus repose might soothe my grief acute love's yoke the spirit may not from it cast with oh what pain it may its ill eject but virtue is attain'd but by pursuit that which in fragrance and in hue defied the odoriferous and lucid east fruits flowers and herbs and leaves and whence the west of all rare excellence obtain'd the prize my laurel sweet which every beauty graced where every glowing virtue loved to dwell beheld beneath its fair and friendly shade my lord and by his side my goddess sit still have i placed in that beloved plant my home of choicest thoughts in fire in frost shivering or burning still i have been bless'd the world was of her perfect honours full when god his own bright heaven therewith to grace reclaim'd her for himself for she was his death thou the world since that dire arrow sped sunless and cold hast left love weak and blind beauty and grace their brilliance have resign'd and from my heavy heart all joy is fled honour is sunk and softness banishèd i weep alone the woes which all my kind should weepfor virtue's fairest flower has pined beneath thy touch what second blooms instead let earth sea air with common wail bemoan man's hapless race which now since laura died a flowerless mead a gemless ring appears the world possess'd nor knew her worth till flown i knew it well who here in grief abide and heaven too knows which decks its forehead with my tears thou death hast left this world's dark cheerless way without a sun love blind and stripp'd of arms left mirth despoil'd beauty bereaved of charms and me selfwearied to myself a prey left vanish'd sunk whate'er was courteous gay i only weep yet all must feel alarms if beauty's bud the hand of rapine harms it dies and not a second views the day let air earth ocean weep for human kind for human kind deprived of laura seems a flowerless mead a ring whose gem is lost none knew her worth while to this orb confined save me her bard whose sorrow ceaseless streams and heaven that's made more beauteous at my cost so far as to mine eyes its light heaven show'd so far as love and study train'd my wings novel and beautiful but mortal things from every star i found on her bestow'd so many forms in rare and varied mode of heavenly beauty from immortal springs my panting intellect before me brings sunk my weak sight before their dazzling load hence whatsoe'er i spoke of her or wrote who at god's right returns me now her prayers is in that infinite abyss a mote for style beyond the genius never dares thus though upon the sun man fix his sight he seeth less as fiercer burns its light dear precious pledge by nature snatch'd away but yet reserved for me in realms undying o thou on whom my life is aye relying why tarry thus when for thine aid i pray time was when sleep could to mine eyes convey sweet visions worthy theewhy is my sighing unheeded nowwho keeps thee from replying surely contempt in heaven cannot stay often on earth the gentlest heart is fain to feed and banquet on another's woe thus love is conquer'd in his own domain but thou who seest through me and dost know all that i feelthou who canst soothe my pain oh let thy blessed shade its peace bestow what angel of compassion hovering near heard and to heaven my heart grief instant bore whence now i feel descending as of yore my lady in that bearing chaste and dear my lone and melancholy heart to cheer so free from pride of humbleness such store in fine so perfect though at death's own door i live and life no more is dull and drear blessèd is she who so can others bless with her fair sight or with that tender speech to whose full meaning love alone can reach dear friend she says thy pangs my soul distress but for our good i did thy homage shun in sweetest tones which might arrest the sun food wherewithal my lord is well supplied with tears and grief my weary heart i've fed as fears within and paleness o'er me spread oft thinking on its fatal wound and wide but in her time with whom no other vied equal or second to my suffering bed comes she to look on whom i almost dread and takes her seat in pity by my side with that fair hand so long desired in vain she check'd my tears while at her accents crept a sweetness to my soul intense divine is this thy wisdom to parade thy pain no longer weep hast thou not amply wept would that such life were thine as death is mine with grief and tears my soul's proud sovereign's food i ever nourish still my aching heart i feel my blanching cheek and oft i start as on love's sharp engraven wound i brood but she who e'er on earth unrivall'd stood flits o'er my couch when prostrate by his dart i lie and there her presence doth impart whilst scarce my eyes dare meet their vision'd good with that fair hand in life i so desired she stays my eyes' sad tide her voice's tone awakes the balm earth ne'er to man can give and thus she speaksoh vain hath wisdom fired the hopeless mourner's breast no more bemoan i am not deadwould thou like me couldst live to that soft look which now adorns the skies the graceful bending of the radiant head the face the sweet angelic accents fled that soothed me once but now awake my sighs oh when to these imagination flies i wonder that i am not long since dead 'tis she supports me for her heavenly tread is round my couch when morning visions rise in every attitude how holy chaste how tenderly she seems to hear the tale of my long woes and their relief to seek but when day breaks she then appears in haste the wellknown heavenward path again to scale with moisten'd eye and soft expressive cheek 'tis sweet though sad my trembling thoughts to raise as memory dwells upon that form so dear and think that now e'en angels join to praise the gentle virtues that adorn'd her here that face that look in fancy to behold to hear that voice that did with music vie the bending head crown'd with its locks of gold _all all_ that charm'd now but sad thoughts supply how had i lived her bitter loss to weep if that pure spirit pitying my woe had not appear'd to bless my troubled sleep ere memory broke upon the world below what pure what gentle greetings then were mine in what attention wrapt she paused to hear my life's sad course of which she bade me speak but as the dawn from forth the east did shine back to that heaven to which her way was clear she fledwhile falling tears bedew'd each cheek love haply was erewhile a sweet relief i scarce know when but now it bitter grows beyond all else who learns from life well knows as i have learnt to know from heavy grief she of our age who was its honour chief who now in heaven with brighter lustre glows has robb'd my being of the sole repose it knew in life though that was rare and brief pitiless death my every good has ta'en not the great bliss of her fair spirit freed can aught console the adverse life i lead i wept and sang who now can wake no strain but day and night the pent griefs of my soul from eyes and tongue in tears and verses roll sorrow and love encouraged my poor tongue discreet in sadness where it should not go to speak of her for whom i burn'd and sung what even were it true 'twere wrong to show that blessèd saint my miserable state might surely soothe and ease my spirit's strife since she in heaven is now domesticate with him who ever ruled her heart in life wherefore i am contented and consoled nor would again in life her form behold nay i prefer to die and live alone fairer than ever to my mental eye i see her soaring with the angels high before our lord her maker and my own my love and grief compell'd me to proclaim my heart's lament and urged me to convey that were it true of her i should not say who woke alike my song and bosom's flame for i should comfort find 'mid this world's shame to mark her soul's beatified array to think that he who here had own'd its sway doth now within his home its presence claim and true i comfort findmyself resign'd i would not woo her back to earthly gloom oh rather let me die or live still lone my mental eye that holds her there enshrined now paints her wing'd bright with celestial bloom prostrate beneath our mutual heaven's throne the chosen angels and the spirits blest celestial tenants on that glorious day my lady join'd them throng'd in bright array around her with amaze and awe imprest what splendour what new beauty stands confest unto our sightamong themselves they say no soul in this vile age from sinful clay to our high realms has risen so fair a guest delighted to have changed her mortal state she ranks amid the purest of her kind and ever and anon she looks behind to mark my progress and my coming wait now my whole thought my wish to heaven i cast 'tis laura's voice i hear and hence she bids me haste the chosen angels and the blest above heaven's citizensthe day when laura ceased to adorn the world about her thronging press'd replete with wonder and with holy love what sight is thiswhat will this beauty prove said they for sure no form in charms so dress'd from yonder globe to this high place of rest in all the latter age did e'er remove she pleased and happy with her mansion new compares herself with the most perfect there and now and then she casts a glance to view if yet i come and seems to wish me near rise then my thoughts to heavenvain world adieu my laura calls her quickening voice i hear lady in bliss who by our maker's feet as suited for thine excellent life alone art now enthroned in high and glorious seat adorn'd with charms nor pearls nor purple own o model high and rare of ladies sweet now in his face to whom all things are known look on my love with that pure faith replete as long my verse and truest tears have shown and know at last my heart on earth to thee was still as now in heaven nor wish'd in life more than beneath thine eyes' bright sun to be wherefore to recompense the tedious strife which turn'd my liege heart from the world away pray that i soon may come with thee to stay lady whose gentle virtues have obtain'd for thee a dwelling with thy maker blest to sit enthroned above in angels' vest whose lustre gold nor purple had attain'd ah thou who here the most exalted reign'd now through the eyes of him who knows each breast that heart's pure faith and love thou canst attest which both my pen and tears alike sustain'd thou knowest too my heart was thine on earth as now it is in heaven no wish was there but to avow thine eyes its only shrine thus to reward the strife which owes its birth to thee who won my each affection'd care pray god to waft me to his home and thine the brightest eyes the most resplendent face that ever shone and the most radiant hair with which nor gold nor sunbeam could compare the sweetest accent and a smile all grace hands arms that would e'en motionless abase those who to love the most rebellious were fine nimble feet a form that would appear like that of her who first did eden trace these fann'd life's spark now heaven and all its choir of angel hosts those kindred charms admire while lone and darkling i on earth remain yet is not comfort fled she who can read each secret of my soul shall intercede and i her sainted form behold again yes from those finest eyes that face most sweet that ever shone and from that loveliest hair with which nor gold nor sunbeam may compare that speech with love that smile with grace replete from those soft hands those white arms which defeat themselves unmoved the stoutest hearts that e'er to love were rebels from those feet so fair from her whole form for eden only meet my spirit took its lifenow these delight the king of heaven and his angelic train while blind and naked i am left in night one only balm expect i 'mid my pain that she mine every thought who now can see may win this gracethat i with her may be methinks from hour to hour her voice i hear my lady calls me i would fain obey within without i feel myself decay and am so alter'dnot with many a year that to myself a stranger i appear all my old usual life is put away could i but know how long i have to stay grant heaven the longwish'd summons may be near oh blest the day when from this earthly gaol i shall be freed when burst and broken lies this mortal guise so heavy yet so frail when from this black night my saved spirit flies soaring up up above the bright serene where with my lord my lady shall be seen on my ofttroubled sleep my sacred air so softly breathes at last i courage take to tell her of my past and present ache which never in her life my heart did dare i first that glance so full of love declare which served my lifelong torment to awake next how content and wretched for her sake love day by day my tost heart knew to tear she speaks not but with pity's dewy trace intently looks on me and gently sighs while pure and lustrous tears begem her face my spirit which her sorrow fiercely tries so to behold her weep with anger burns and freed from slumber to itself returns each day to me seems as a thousand years that i my dear and faithful star pursue who guided me on earth and guides me too by a sure path to life without its tears for in the world familiar now appears no snare to tempt so rare a light and true shines e'en from heaven my secret conscience through of lost time and loved sin the glass it rears not that i need the threats of death to dread which he who loved us bore with greater pain that firm and constant i his path should tread 'tis but a brief while since in every vein of her he enter'd who my fate has been yet troubled not the least her brow serene death cannot make that beauteous face less fair but that sweet face may lend to death a grace my spirit's guide from her each good i trace who learns to die may seek his lesson there that holy one who not his blood would spare but did the dark tartarean bolts unbrace he too doth from my soul death's terrors chase then welcome death thy impress i would wear and linger not 'tis time that i had fled alas my stay hath little here avail'd since she my laura blest resign'd her breath life's spring in me hath since that hour lain dead in her i lived my life in hers exhaled the hour she died i felt within me death when she the faithful soother of my pain this life's long weary pilgrimage to cheer vouchsafes beside my nightly couch to appear with her sweet speech attempering reason's strain o'ercome by tenderness and terror vain i cry whence comest thou o spirit blest she from her beauteous breast a branch of laurel and of palm displays and answering thus she says from th' empyrean seat of holy love alone thy sorrows to console i move in actions and in words in humble guise i speak my thanks and ask how may it be that thou shouldst know my wretched state and she thy floods of tears perpetual and thy sighs breathed forth unceasing to high heaven arise and there disturb thy blissful state serene so grievous hath it been that freed from this poor being i at last to a better life have pass'd which should have joy'd thee hadst thou loved as well as thy sad brow and sadder numbers tell oh not thy ills i but deplore my own in darkness and in grief remaining here certain that thou hast reach'd the highest sphere as of a thing that man hath seen and known would god and nature to the world have shown such virtue in a young and gentle breast were not eternal rest the appointed guerdon of a life so fair thou of the spirits rare who from a course unspotted pure and high are suddenly translated to the sky but i how can i cease to weep forlorn without thee nothing wretched desolate oh in the cradle had i met my fate or at the breast and not to love been born and she why by consuming grief thus worn were it not better spread aloft thy wings and now all mortal things with these thy sweet and idle fantasies at their just value prize and follow me if true thy tender vows gathering henceforth with me these honour'd boughs then answering herfain would i thou shouldst say what these two verdant branches signify methinks she says thou may'st thyself reply whose pen has graced the one by many a lay the palm shows victory and in youth's bright day i overcame the world and my weak heart the triumph mine in part glory to him who made my weakness strength and thou yet turn at length 'gainst other powers his gracious aid implore that we may be with him thy trial o'er are these the crisped locks and links of gold that bind me still and these the radiant eyes to me the sun err not with the unwise nor think she says as they are wont behold in me a spirit among the blest enroll'd thou seek'st what hath long been earth again yet to relieve thy pain 'tis given me thus to appear ere i resume that beauty from the tomb more loved that i severe in pity win thy soul with mine to heaven from death and sin i weep and she my cheek soft sighing with her own fair hand will dry and gently chiding speak in tones of power to rive hard rocks in twain then vanishing sleep follows in her train long had i suffer'd tillto combat more in strength in hope too sunkat last before impartial reason's seat whence she presides our nobler nature o'er i summon'd my old tyrant stern and sweet there groaning 'neath a weary weight of grief with fear and horror stung like one who dreads to die and prays relief my plea i open'd thus when life was young i weakly placed my peace within his power and nothing from that hour save wrong i've met so many and so great the torments i have borne that my once infinite patience is outworn and my life worthless grown is held in very hate thus sadly has my time till now dragg'd by in flames and anguish i have left each way of honour use and joy this my most cruel flatterer to obey what wit so rare such language to employ that yet may free me from this wretched thrall or even my complaint so great and just against this ingrate paint o little sweet much bitterness and gall how have you changed my life so tranquil ere with the false witchery blind that alone lured me to his amorous snare if right i judge a mind i boasted once with higher feelings rife but he destroy'd my peace he plunged me in this strife less for myself to care through him i've grown and less my god to honour than i ought through him my every thought on a frail beauty blindly have i thrown in this my counsellor he stood alone still prompt with cruel aid so to provoke my young desire that i hoped respite from his harsh and heavy yoke but ah what bootsthough changing time sweep by if from this changeless passion nought can save a genius proud and high or what heaven's other envied gifts to have if still i groan the slave of the fierce despot whom i here accuse who turns e'en my sad life to his triumphant use 'twas he who made me desert countries seek wild tribes and nations dangerous manners rude my path with thorns he strew'd and every error that betrays the weak valley and mountain marsh and stream and sea on every side his snares were set for me in june december came with present peril and sharp toil the same alone they left me never neither he nor she whom i so fled my other foe untimely in my tomb if by some painful death not yet laid low my safety from such doom heaven's gracious pity not this tyrant deigns who feeds upon my grief and profits in my pains no quiet hour since first i own'd his reign i've known nor hope to know repose is fled from my unfriendly bed nor herb nor spells can bring it back again by fraud and force he gain'd and guards his power o'er every sense soundeth from steeple near by day by night the hour i feel his hand in every stroke i hear never did cankerworm fair tree devour as he my heart wherein he gnawing lurks and there my ruin works hence my past martyrdom and tears arise my present speech these sighs which tear and tire myself and haply thee judge then between us both thou knowest him and me with fierce reproach my adversary rose lady he spoke the rebel to a close is heard at last the truth receive from me which he has shrunk to tell big words to bandy specious lies to sell he plies right well the vile trade of his youth freed from whose shame to share my easy pleasures by my friendly care from each false passion which had work'd him ill kept safe and pure laments he graceless still the sweet life he has gain'd and blindly thus his fortune dares he blame who owes his very fame to me his genius who sublimed sustain'd in the proud flight to which he else had dared not aim well knows he how in history's every page the laurell'd chief the monarch on his throne the poet and the sage favourites of fortune or for virtue known were cursed by evil stars in loves debased soulless and vile their hearts their fame to waste while i for him alone from all the lovely ladies of the earth chose one so graced with beauty and with worth the eternal sun her equal ne'er beheld such charm was in her life such virtue in her speech with music rife their wondrous power dispell'd each vain and vicious fancy from his heart a foe i am indeed if this a foeman's part such was my anger these my hate and slights than all which others could bestow more sweet evil for good i meet if thus ingratitude my grace requites so high upon my wings he soar'd in fame to hear his song fair dames and gentle knights in throngs delighted came among the gifted spirits of our time his name conspicuous shines in every clime admired approved his strains an echo find such is he but for me a mere court flatterer who was doom'd to be unmark'd amid his kind till in my school exalted and made known by her who of her sex stood peerless and alone if my great service more there need to tell i have so fenced and fortified him well that his pure mind on nought of gross or grovelling now can brook to dwell modest and sensitive in deed word thought her captive from his youth she so her fair and virtuous image press'd upon his heart it left its likeness there whate'er his life has shown of good or great in aim or action he from us possess'd never was midnight dream so full of error as to us his hate for heaven's and man's esteem if still he keep the praise is due to us whom in its thankless pride his blind rage censures thus in fine 'twas i my past love to exceed who heavenward fix'd his hope who gave him wings to fly from mortal things which to eternal bliss the path impede with his own sense that seeing how in her virtues and charms so great and rare combined a holy pride might stir and to the great first cause exalt his mind in his own verse confess'd this truth we see while that dear lady whom i sent to be the grace the guard and guide of his vain lifebut here a heartdeep groan i sudden gave and cried yes sent and snatch'd her from me he replied not i but heaven above which will'd her for its own at length before that high tribunal each with anxious trembling i while in his mien was conscious triumph seen with earnest prayer concluded thus his speech speak noble lady we thy judgment wait she then with equal air it glads me to have heard your keen debate but in a cause so great more time and thought it needs just verdict to declare i cited once t' appear before the noble queen that ought to guide each mortal life that in this world is seen that pleasant cruel foe that robbeth hearts of ease and now doth frown and then doth fawn and can both grieve and please and there as gold in fire full fined to each intent charged with fear and terror eke i did myself present as one that doubted death and yet did justice crave and thus began t' unfold my cause in hope some help to have madam in tender youth i enter'd first this reign where other sweet i never felt than grief and great disdain and eke so sundry kinds of torments did endure as life i loathed and death desired my cursèd case to cure and thus my woeful days unto this hour have pass'd in smoky sighs and scalding tears my wearied life to waste o lord what graces great i fled and eke refused to serve this cruel crafty sire that doubtless trust abused what wit can use such words to argue and debate what tongue express the full effect of mine unhappy state what hand with pen can paint t' uncipher this deceit what heart so hard that would not yield that once hath seen his bate what great and grievous wrongs what threats of ill success what single sweet mingled with mass of double bitterness with what unpleasant pangs with what an hoard of pains hath he acquainted my green years by his false pleasant trains who by resistless power hath forced me sue his dance that if i be not much abused had found much better and when i most resolved to lead most quiet life chance he spoil'd me of discordless state and thrust me in truceless strife he hath bewitch'd me so that god the less i served and due respect unto myself the further from me swerv'd he hath the love of one so painted in my thought that other thing i can none mind nor care for as i ought and all this comes from him both counsel and the cause that whet my young desire so much to th' honour of his laws my faithful mirror oft to me has told my weary spirit and my shrivell'd skin my failing powers to prove it all begin deceive thyself no longer thou art old man is in all by nature best controll'd and if with her we struggle time creeps in at the sad truth on fire as waters win a long and heavy sleep is off me roll'd and i see clearly our vain life depart that more than once our being cannot be her voice sounds ever in my inmost heart who now from her fair earthly frame is free she walk'd the world so peerless and alone its fame and lustre all with her are flown the mirror'd friendmy changing form hath read my every power's incipient decay my wearied soulalike in warning say thyself no more deceive thy youth hath fled 'tis ever best to be by nature led we strive with her and death makes us his prey at that dread thought as flames the waters stay the dream is gone my life hath sadly fed i wake to feel how soon existence flies once known 'tis gone and never to return still vibrates in my heart the thrilling tone of her who now her beauteous shrine defies but she who here to rival none could learn hath robb'd her sex and with its fame hath flown so often on the wings of thought i fly up to heaven's blissful seats that i appear as one of those whose treasure is lodged there the rent veil of mortality thrown by a pleasing chillness thrills my heart while i listen to her voice who bids me paleness wear ah now my friend i love thee now revere for changed thy face thy manners doth she cry she leads me to her lord and then i bow preferring humble prayer he would allow that i his glorious face and hers might see thus he replies thy destiny's secure to stay some twenty or some ten years more is but a little space though long it seems to thee death has the bright sun quench'd which wont to burn her pure and constant eyes his dark realms hold she now is dust who dealt me heat and cold to common trees my chosen laurels turn hence i at once my bliss and bane discern none now there is my feelings who can mould from fire to frost from timorous to bold in grief to languish or with hope to yearn out of his tyrant hands who harms and heals erewhile who made in it such havoc sore my heart the bittersweet of freedom feels and to the lord whom thankful i adore the heavens who ruleth merely with his brow i turn lifeweary if not satiate now love held me one and twenty years enchain'd his flame was joyfor hope was in my grief for ten more years i wept without relief when laura with my heart to heaven attain'd now weary grown my life i had arraign'd that in its error check'd to my belief blest virtue's seedsnow in my yellow leaf i grieve the misspent years existence stain'd alas it might have sought a brighter goal in flying troublous thoughts and winning peace o father i repentant seek thy throne thou in this temple hast enshrined my soul oh bless me yet and grant its safe release unjustifiedmy sin i humbly own weeping i still revolve the seasons flown in vain idolatry of mortal things not soaring heavenward though my soul had wings which might perchance a glorious flight have shown o thou discerner of the guilt i own giver of life immortal king of kings heal thou the wounded heart which conscience stings it looks for refuge only to thy throne thus although life was warfare and unrest be death the haven of peace and if my day was vainyet make the parting moment blest through this brief remnant of my earthly way and in death's billows be thy hand confess'd full well thou know'st this hope is all my stay still do i mourn the years for aye gone by which on a mortal love i lavishèd nor e'er to soar my pinions balancèd though wing'd perchance no humble height to fly thou dread invisible who from on high look'st down upon this suffering erring head oh be thy succour to my frailty sped and with thy grace my indigence supply my life in storms and warfare doom'd to spend harbour'd in peace that life may i resign it's course though idle pious be its end oh for the few brief days which yet are mine and for their close thy guiding hand extend thou know'st on thee alone my heart's firm hopes recline o sweet severity repulses mild with chasten'd love and tender pity fraught graceful rebukes that to mad passion taught becoming mastery o'er its wishes wild speech dignified in which united smiled all courtesy with purity of thought virtue and beauty that uprooted aught of baser temper had my heart defiled eyes in whose glance man is beatified awful in pride of virtue to restrain aspiring hopes that justly are denied then prompt the drooping spirit to sustain these beautiful in every change supplied health to my soul that else were sought in vain blest spirit that with beams so sweetly clear those eyes didst bend on me than stars more bright and sighs didst breathe and words which could delight despair and which in fancy still i hear i see thee now radiant from thy pure sphere o'er the soft grass and violet's purple light move as an angel to my wondering sight more present than earth gave thee to appear yet to the cause supreme thou art return'd and left here to dissolve that beauteous veil in which indulgent heaven invested thee th' impoverish'd world at thy departure mourn'd for love departed and the sun grew pale and death then seem'd our sole felicity o blessed spirit who those sunlike eyes so sweetly didst inform and brightly fill who the apt words didst frame and tender sighs which in my fond heart have their echo still erewhile i saw thee glowing with chaste flame thy feet 'mid violets and verdure set moving in angel not in mortal frame lifelike and light before me present yet her when returning with thy god to dwell thou didst relinquish and that fair veil given for purpose high by fortune's grace to thee love at thy parting bade the world farewell courtesy died the sun abandon'd heaven and death himself our best friend 'gan to be ah love some succour to my weak mind deign lend to my frail and weary style thine aid to sing of her who is immortal made a citizen of the celestial reign and grant lord that my verse the height may gain of her great praises else in vain essay'd whose peer in worth or beauty never stay'd in this our world unworthy to retain love answers in myself and heaven what lay by

i tell for sighs poor solitary bird that pour'st thy lay or haply mournest the sweet season gone as chilly night and winter hurry on and daylight fades and summer flies away if as the cares that swell thy little throat thou knew'st alike the woes that wound my rest ah thou wouldst house thee in this kindred breast and mix with mine thy melancholy note yet little know i ours are kindred ills she still may live the object of thy song not so for me stern death or heaven wills but the sad season and less grateful hour and of past joy and sorrow thoughts that throng prompt my full heart this idle lay to pour sweet bird that singest on thy airy way or else bewailest pleasures that are past what time the night draws nigh and wintry blast leaving behind each merry month and day oh couldst thou as thine own my state survey with the same gloom of misery o'ercast unto my bosom thou mightst surely haste and by partaking my sad griefs allay yet would thy share of woe not equal mine since the loved

very man that my last sigh in peace may in his arms be breathed [illustration petrarch's house at arqua] it was the time when i do sadly pay my sighs in tribute to that sweetsour day which first gave being to my tedious woes the sun now o'er the bull's horns proudly goes and phaëton had renew'd his wonted race when love the season and my own ill case drew me that solitary place to find in which i oft unload my chargèd mind there tired with raving thoughts and helpless moan sleep seal'd my eyes up and my senses gone my waking fancy spied a shining light in which appear'd long pain and short delight a mighty general i then did see like one who for some glorious victory should to the capitol in triumph go i who had not been used to such a show in this soft age where we no valour have but pride admired his habit strange and brave and having raised mine eyes which wearied were to understand this sight was all my care four snowy steeds a fiery chariot drew there sat the cruel boy a threatening yew his right hand bore his quiver arrows held against whose force no helm or shield prevail'd two partycolour'd wings his shoulders ware all naked else and round about his chair were thousand mortals some in battle ta'en many were hurt with darts and many slain glad to learn news i rose and forward press'd so far that i was one amongst the rest as if i had been kill'd with loving pain before my time and looking through the train of this tearthirsty king i would have spied some of my old acquaintance but descried no face i knew if any such there were they were transform'd with prison death and care at last one ghost less sad than th' others came who near approaching call'd me by my name and said this comes of love what may you be i answer'd wondering much that thus know me for i remember not t' have seen your face he thus replied it is the dusky place that dulls thy sight and this hard yoke i bear else i a tuscan am thy friend and dear to thy remembrance his wonted phrase and voice did then discover what he was so we retired aside and left the throng when thus he spake i have expected long to see you here with us your face did seem to threaten you no less i do esteem your prophesies but i have seen what care attends a lover's life and must beware yet have i oft been beaten in the field and sometimes hurt said i but scorn'd to yield he smiled and said alas thou dost not see my son how great a flame's prepared for thee i knew not then what by his words he meant but since i find it by the dire event and in my memory 'tis fix'd so fast that marble gravings cannot firmer last meanwhile my forward youth did thus inquire what may these people be i much desire to know their names pray give me leave to ask i think ere long 'twill be a needless task replied my friend thou shalt be of the train and know them all this captivating chain thy neck must bear though thou dost little fear and sooner change thy comely form and hair than be unfetter'd from the cruel tie howe'er thou struggle for thy liberty yet to fulfil thy wish i will relate what i have learn'd the first that keeps such state by whom our lives and freedoms we forego the world hath call'd him love and he you know but shall know better when he comes to be a lord to you as now he is to me is in his childhood mild fierce in his age 'tis best believed of those that feel his rage the truth of this thou in thyself shalt find i warn thee now pray keep it in thy mind of idle looseness he is oft the child with pleasant fancies nourish'd and is styled or made a god by vain and foolish men and for a recompense some meet their bane others a harder slavery must endure than many thousand chains and bolts procure that other gallant lord is conqueror of conquering rome led captive by the fair egyptian queen with her persuasive art who in his honours claims the greatest part for binding the world's victor with her charms his trophies are all hers by right of arms the next is his adoptive son whose love may seem more just but doth no better prove for though he did his lovèd livia wed she was seducèd from her husband's bed nero is third disdainful wicked fierce and yet a woman found a way to pierce his angry soul behold marcus the grave wise emperor is fair faustina's slave these two are tyrants dionysius and alexander both suspicious and yet both loved the last a just reward found of his causeless fear i know y' have heard of him who for creüsa on the rock antandrus mourn'd so long whose warlike stroke at once revenged his friend and won his love and of the youth whom phædra could not move t' abuse his father's bed he left the place and by his virtue lost his life for base unworthy loves to rage do quickly change it kill'd her too perhaps in just revenge of wrong'd theseus slain hippolytus and poor forsaken ariadne thus it often proves that they who falsely blame another in one breath themselves condemn and who have guilty been of treachery need not complain if they deceivèd be behold the brave hero a captive made with all his fame and twixt these sisters led who as he joy'd the death of th' one to see his death did ease the other's misery the next that followeth though the world admire his strength love bound him th' other full of ire is great achilles he whose pitied fate was caused by love demophoon did not hate impatient phyllis yet

mournful despised wounded to see a stranger's love prevail more than her own a greek here is the frail fair helena with her the shepherd boy whose gazing looks hurt greece and ruin'd troy 'mongst

maid bewails protesilaus argia proved to polynice more faithful than the loved but false and covetous amphiaraus' wife the groans and sighs of those who lose their life by this kind lord in unrelenting flames you hear i cannot tell you half their names for they appear not only men that love the gods themselves do fill this myrtle grove you see fair venus caught by vulcan's art with angry mars proserpina apart from pluto jealous juno yellowhair'd apollo who the young god's courage dared and of his trophies proud laugh'd at the bow which in thessalia gave him such a blow what shall i sayhere in a word are all the gods that varro mentions great and small each with innumerable bonds detain'd and jupiter before the chariot chain'd wearied not satisfied with much delight now here now there i turn'd my greedy sight and many things i view'd to write were long the time is short great store of passions throng within my breast when lo a lovely pair join'd hand in hand who kindly talking were drew my attention that way their attire and foreign language quicken'd my desire of further knowledge which i soon might gain my kind interpreter did all explain when both i knew i boldly then drew near he loved our country though she made it fear o masinissa i adjure thee by great scipio and her who from thine eye drew manly tears said i let it not be a trouble what i must demand of thee he look'd and said i first desire to know your name and quality for well you show y' have heard the combat in my wounded soul when love did friendship friendship love control i am not worth your knowledge my poor flame gives little light said i your royal fame sets hearts on fire that never see your face but pray you say are you two led in peace by himi show'd their guideyour history deserves record it seemeth strange to me that faith and cruelty should come so near he said thine own expressions witness bear thou know'st enough yet i will all relate to thee 't will somewhat ease my heavy state on that brave man my heart was fix'd so much that lælius' love to him could be but such where'er his colours marchèd i was nigh and fortune did attend with victory yet still his merit call'd for more than she could give or any else deserve but he when to the west the roman eagles came myself was also there and caught a flame a purer never burnt in lover's breast but such a joy could not be long possess'd our nuptial knot alas he soon untied who had more power than all the world beside he cared not for our sighs and though 't be true that he divided us his worth i knew he must be blind that cannot see the sun but by strict justice love is quite undone counsel from such a friend gave such a stroke to love it almost split as on a rock for as my father i his wrath did fear and as a son he in my love was dear brothers in age we were him i obey'd but with a troubled soul and look dismay'd thus my dear half had an untimely death she prized her freedom far above her breath and i th' unhappy instrument was made such force th' intreaty and intreater had i rather chose myself than him t' offend and sent the poison brought her to her end with what sad thoughts i know and she'll confess and you if you have sense of love may guess no heir she left me but my tedious moan and though in her my hopes and joys were gone she was of lower value than my faith but now farewell and try if this troop hath another wonder for the time is less than is the task i pitied their distress whose short joy ended in so sharp a woe my soft heart melted as they onward go this youth for his part i perhaps could love she said but nothing can my mind remove from hatred of the nation he replied good sophonisba you may leave this pride your city hath by us been three times beat the last of which you know we laid it flat pray use these words t' another not to me said she if africk mournèd italy needs not rejoice search your records and there see what you gainèd by the punic war he that was friend to both without reply a little smiling vanish'd from mine eye amongst the crowd as one in doubtful way at every step looks round and fears to stray care stops his journey so the varied store of lovers stay'd me to examine more and try what kind of fire burnt every breast when on my left hand strayèd from the rest was one whose look express'd a ready mind in seeking what he joy'd yet shamed to find he freely gave away his dearest wife a newfound way to save a lover's life she though she joy'd yet blushèd at the change as they recounted their affections strange and for their syria mourn'd i took the way of these three ghosts who seem'd their course to stay and take another path the first i held and bid him turn he started and beheld me with a troubled look hearing my tongue was roman such a pause he made as sprung from some deep thought then spake as if inspired for to my wish he told what i desired to know seleucus is said he my name this is antiochus my son whose fame hath reach'd your ear he warrèd much with rome but reason oft by power is overcome this woman once my wife doth now belong to him i gave her and it was no wrong in our religion it stay'd his death threaten'd by love stratonica she hath to name so now we may enjoy one state and our fast friendship shall outlast all date she from her height was willing to descend i quit my joy he rather chose his end than our offence and in his prime had died had not the wise physician been our guide silence in love o'ercame his vital part his love was force his silence virtuous art a father's tender care made me agree to this strange change this said he turn'd from me as changing his design with such a pace ere i could take my leave he had quit the place after the ghost was carried from mine eye amazedly i walk'd nor could untie my mind from his sad story till my friend admonish'd me and said you must not lend attention thus to everything you meet you know the number's great and time is fleet more naked

artemisia were all good the other three as wicked are semiramis byblis and myrrha named who of their crooked ways are now ashamed here be the erring knights in ancient scrolls lancelot tristram and the vulgar souls that wait on these guenever and the fair isond with other lovers and the pair who as they walk together seem to plain their just but cruel fate by one hand slain thus he discoursed and as a man that fears approaching harm when he a trumpet hears starts at the blow ere touch'd my frighted blood retired as one raised from his tomb i stood when by my side i spied a lovely maid no turtle ever purer whiteness had and straight was caught who lately swore i would defend me from a man at arms nor could resist the wounds of words with motion graced the image yet is in my fancy placed my friend was willing to increase my woe and smiling whisper'dyou alone may go confer with whom you please for now we are all stained with one crime my sullen care was like to theirs who are more grieved to know another's happiness than their own woe for seeing her who had enthrall'd my mind live free in peace and no disturbance find and seeing that i knew my hurt too late and that her beauty was my dying fate love jealousy and envy held my sight so fix'd on that fair face no other light i could behold like one who in the rage of sickness greedily his thirst would 'suage with hurtful drink which doth his palate please thus blind and deaf t' all other joys are ease so many doubtful ways i follow'd her the memory still shakes my soul with fear since when mine eyes are moist and view the ground my heart is heavy and my steps have found a solitary dwelling 'mongst the woods i stray o'er rocks and fountains hills and floods since when such store my scatter'd papers hold of thoughts of tears of ink which oft i fold unfold and tear since when i know the scope of love and what they fear and what they hope and how they live that in his cloister dwell the skilful in their face may read it well meanwhile i see how fierce and gallant she cares not for me nor for my misery proud of her virtue and my overthrow and on the other side if aught i know this lord who hath the world in triumph led she keeps in fear thus all my hopes are dead no strength nor courage left nor can i be revenged as i expected once for he who tortures me and others is abused by her she'll not be caught and long hath used rebellious as she is to shun his wars and is a sun amidst the lesser stars her grace smiles slights her words in order set her hair dispersed or in a golden net her eyes inflaming with a light divine so burn my heart i dare no more repine ah who is able fully to express her pleasing ways her merit no excess no bold hyperboles i need to fear my humble style cannot enough come near the truth my words are like a little stream compared with th' ocean so large a theme is that high praise new worth not seen before is seen in her and can be seen no more therefore all tongues are silenced and i her prisoner now see her at liberty and night and day implore o unjust fate she neither hears nor pities my estate hard laws of love but though a partial lot i plainly see in this yet must i not refuse to serve the gods as well as men with like reward of old have felt like pain now know i how the mind itself doth part now making peace now war now trucewhat art poor lovers use to hide their stinging woe and how their blood now comes and now doth go betwixt their heart and cheeks by shame or fear how they be eloquent yet speechless are and how they both ways lean they watch and sleep languish to death yet life and vigour keep i trod the paths made happy by her feet and search the foe i am afraid to meet i know how lovers metamorphosed are to that they love i know what tedious care i feel how vain my joy how oft i change design and countenance and which is strange i live without a soul i know the way to cheat myself a thousand times a day i know to follow while i flee my fire i freeze when present absent my desire is hot i know what cruel rigour love practiseth on the mind and doth remove all reason thence and how he racks the heart and how a soul hath neither strength nor art without a helper to resist his blows and how he flees and how his darts he throws and how his threats the fearful lover feels and how he robs by force and how he steals how oft his wheels turn round now high now low with how uncertain hope how certain woe how all his promises be void of faith and how a fire hid in our bones he hath how in our veins he makes a secret wound whence open flames and death do soon abound in sum i know how giddy and how vain be lovers' lives what fear and boldness reign in all their ways how every sweet is paid and with a double weight of sour allay'd i also know their customs sighs and songs their sudden muteness and their stammering tongues how short their joy how long their pain doth last how wormwood spoileth all their honey's taste when once my will was captive by my fate and i had lost the liberty which late made my life happy i who used before to flee from love as fearful deer abhor the following huntsman suddenly became like all my fellowservants calm and tame and view'd the travails wrestlings and the smart the crooked bypaths and the cozening art that guides the amorous flock then whilst mine eye i cast in every corner to espy some ancient or modern who had proved famous i saw him who had only loved eurydice and found out hell to call her dear ghost back he named her in his fall for whom he died aleæus there was known skilful in love and verse anacreon whose muse sung nought but love pindarus he was also there there i might virgil see many brave wits i found some looser rhymes by others writ hath pleased the ancient times ovid was one after catullus came propertius next his elegies the name of cynthia bear tibullus and the young greek poetess who is received among the noble troop for her rare sapphic muse thus looking here and there as oft i use i spied much people on a flowery plain amongst themselves disputes of love maintain behold beatrice with dante selvaggia she brought her pistoian cino guitton may be offended that he is the latter named behold both guidos for their learning famed th' honest bolognian the sicilians first wrote love in rhymes but wrote their rhymes the worst franceschin and sennuccio whom all know were worthy and humane after did go a squadron of another garb and phrase of whom arnaldo daniel hath most praise great master in love's art his style as new as

whose tongues were helm shield sword and spear all their offensive arms and their defensive to prevent their harms from those i turn'd comparing my own woe to view my countryfolks and there might know the good tomasso who did once adorn bologna now messina holds his urn ah vanish'd joys ah life too full of bane how wert thou from mine eyes so quickly ta'en since without thee nothing is in my power to do where art thou from me at this hour what is our life if aught it bring of ease a sick man's dream a fable told to please some few there from the common road did stray lælius and socrates with whom i may a longer progress take oh what a pair of dear esteemèd friends to me they were 'tis not my verse nor prose may reach thieir praise neither of these can naked virtue raise above her own true place with them i have reach'd many heights one yoke of learning gave laws to our steps to them my fester'd wound i oft have show'd no time or place i found to part from them and hope and wish we may be undivided till my breath decay with them i used too early to adorn my head with th' honour'd branches only worn for her dear sake i did so deeply love who fill'd my thoughts but ah i daily prove no fruit nor leaves from thence can gather'd be the root hath sharp and bitter been to me for this i was accustomed much to vex but i have seen that which my anger checks a theme for buskins not a comic stage she took the god adored by the rage of such dull fools as he had captive led but first i'll tell you what of us he made then from her hand what was his own sad fate which orpheus or homer might relate his winged coursers o'er the ditches leapt and we their way as desperately kept till he had reached where his mother reigns nor would he ever pull or turn the reins but scour'd o'er woods and mountains none did care nor could discern in what strange world they were beyond the place where old Ægeus mourns an island lies phoebus none sweeter burns nor neptune ever bathed a better shore about the midst a beauteous hill with store of shades and pleasing smells so fresh a spring as drowns all manly thoughts this place doth bring venus much joy 't was given her deity ere blind man knew a truer god than she of which original it yet retains too much so little goodness there remains that it the vicious doth only please is by the virtuous shunn'd as a disease here this fine lord insulteth o'er us all tied in a chain from thule to ganges' fall griefs in our breasts vanity in our arms fleeting delights are there and weighty harms repentance swiftly following to annoy such tarquin found it and the bane of troy all that whole valley with the echoes rung of running brooks and birds that gently sung the banks were clothed in yellow purple green scarlet and white their pleasing springs were seen and gliding streams amongst the tender grass thickets and soft winds to refresh the place after when winter maketh sharp the air warm leaves and leisure sports and gallant cheer enthrall low minds now th' equinox hath made the day t' equal the night and progne had with her sweet sister each their old task ta'en ah how the faith in fortune placed is vain just in the time and place and in the hour when humble tears should earthly joys devour it pleased him whom th' vulgar honour so to triumph over me and now i know what miserable servitude they prove what ruin and what death that fall in love errors dreams paleness waiteth on his chair false fancies o'er the door and on the stair are slippery hopes unprofitable gain and gainful loss such steps it doth contain as who descend may boast their fortune best who most ascend most fall a wearied rest and resting trouble glorious disgrace a duskish and obscure illustriousness unfaithful loyalty and cozening faith that nimble fury lazy reason hath a prison whose wide ways do all receive whose narrow paths a hard retiring leave a steep descent by which we slide with ease but find no hold our crawling steps to raise within confusion turbulence annoy are mix'd undoubted woe and doubtful joy vulcano where the sooty cyclops dwell liparis stromboli nor mongibel nor ischia have more horrid noise and smoke he hates himself that stoops to such a yoke thus were we all throng'd in so strait a cage i changed my looks and hair before my age dreaming on liberty by strong desire my soul made apt to hope and did admire those gallant minds enslaved to such a woe my heart within my breast dissolved like snow before the sun as one would sideways cast his eye on pictures which his feet hath pass'd the fatal morning dawn'd that brought again the sad memorial of my ancient pain that day the source of longprotracted woe when i began the plagues of love to know hyperion's throne along the azure field between the splendid horns of taurus wheel'd and from her spouse the queen of morn withdrew her sandals gemm'd with frostbespangled dew sad recollection rising with the morn of my disastrous love repaid with scorn oppressed my sense till welcome soft repose gave a short respite from my swelling woes then seem'd i in a vision borne away where a deep winding vale sequester'd lay nor long i rested on the flowery green ere a soft radiance dawn'd along the scene fallacious sign of hope for close behind dark shades of coming woe were seen combined there on his car a conqu'ring chief i spied like rome's proud sons that led the living tide of vanquished foes in long triumphal state to capitolian jove's disclosing gate with little joy i saw the splendid show spent and dejected by my lengthen'd woe sick of the world and all its worthless train that world where all the hateful passions reign and yet intent the mystic cause to find for knowledge is the banquet of the mind languid and slow i turn'd my cheerless eyes on the proud warrior and his uncouth guise high on his seat an archer youth was seen with loaded quiver and malicious mien nor plate nor mail his cruel shaft can ward nor polish'd burganet the temples guard his burning chariot seem'd by coursers drawn while like the snows that clothe the wintry lawn his waving wings with rainbow colour gay on either naked shoulder seem'd to play and filing far behind a countless train in sad procession hid the groaning plain some captive seem'd in long disastrous strife some in the deadly fray bereft of life and freshly wounded some a viewless hand led me to mingle with the mornful band and learn the fortunes of the sentenced crew who pierced by love had bid the world adieu with keen survey i mark'd the ghostly show to find a shade among the sons of woe to memory known but every trace was lost in the dim features of the moving host oblivion's hand had drawn a dark disguise o'er their wan lineaments and beamless eyes at length a pallid face i seem'd to know which wore methought a lighter mask of woe he call'd me by my namebehold he cried what plagues the hapless thralls of love abide how am i known by thee with new surprise i cried no mark recalls thee to my eyes oh heavy is my load he seem'd to say through this dark medium no detecting ray assists thy sight but i like thee can boast my birth on famed etruria's ancient coast the secret which his murky mask conceal'd his wellknown voice and tuscan tongue reveal'd thence to a lighter station we repair'd and thus the phantom spoke with mild regard we thought to see thy name with ours enroll'd long since for oft thy looks this fate foretold true i replied but i survived the strife his arrows reach'd me but were short of life pausing he spokea spark to flame will rise and bear thy name in glory to the skies his meaning was obscure but in my breast i felt the substance of his words impress'd as sculptured stone or monumental brass keeps the firm record or heroic face with youthful ardour new and hope inspired quick from my grave companion i required the name and fortunes of the passing train and why in mournful pomp they trod the plain time he return'd the secret then will show when thou shalt join the retinue of woe but years shall sprinkle o'er thy locks with gray and alter'd looks the signs of age betray ere at his powerful touch the fetters fall which many a moon thy captive limbs shall gall yet will i grant thy suit and give to view the various fortunes of the captive crew but mark their leader first that chief renown'd the power of love by every nation own'd his sway thou soon as well as we shalt know stung to the heart by goads of dulcet woe in him unthinking youth's misgovern'd rage join'd with the cool malignity of age is known to mingle with insidious guile deep deep conceal'd beneath an infant's smile the child of slothful ease and sensual heat by sweet delirious thoughts in dark retreat mature in mischief grownhe springs away a wingèd god and thousands own his sway some as thou seest are number'd with the dead and some the bitter drops of sorrow shed through lingering life by viewless tangles bound that link the soul and chain it to the ground there cæsar walks of celtic laurels proud nor feels himself in sensual bondage bow'd he treads the flowery path nor sees the snare laid for his honour by the egyptian fair here love his triumph shows and leads along the world's great owner in the captive throng and o'er the master of unscepter'd kings exulting soars and claps his purple wings see his adopted son he knew her guile and nobly scorn'd the siren of the nile yet fell by roman charms and from her spouse the pregnant consort bore regardless of her vows there cruel nero feels his iron heart lanced by imperious love's resistless dart replete with rage and scorning human ties he falls the victim of two conquering eyes deep ambush'd there in philosophic spoils the little tyrant tries his artful wiles e'en in that hallow'd breast where deep enshrined lay all the varied treasures of the mind he lodged his venom'd shaft the hoary sage like meaner mortals felt the passion rage in boundless fury for a strumpet's charms and clasp'd the shining mischief in his arms see dionysius link'd with pheræ's lord pale doubt and dread on either front abhorr'd scowl terrible yet love assign'd their doom a wife and mistress mark'd them for the tomb the next is he that on antandros' coast his fair crëusa mourn'd for ever lost yet cut the bonds of love on tyber's shore and bought a bride with young evander's gore here droop'd the victim of a lawless flame the amorous frenzy of the cretan dame he fled abhorrent and contemn'd her tears and to the dire suggestion closed his ears but nought alas his purity avail'd fate in his flight the hapless youth assail'd by interdicted love to vengeance fired and by his father's curse the son expired the stepdame shared his fate and dearly paid a spouse a sister and a son betray'd her conscience by the false impeachment stung upon herself return'd the deadly wrong and he that broke before his plighted vows met his deserts in an adulterous spouse see where he droops between the sister dames and fondly meltsthe other scorns his flames the mighty slave of omphale behind is seen and he whom love and fraud combined sent to the shades of everlasting night and still he seems to weep his wretched plight there phyllis mourns demophoon's broken vows and fell medea there pursues her spouse with impious boast and shrill upbraiding cries she tells him how she broke the holy ties of kindred for his sake the guilty shore that from her poignard drank a brother's gore the deep affliction of her royal sire who heard her flight with imprecations dire see beauteous helen with her trojan swain the royal youth that fed his amorous pain with ardent gaze on those destructive charms that waken'd half the warring world to arms yonder behold oenone's wild despair who mourns the triumphs of the spartan fair the injured husband answers groan for groan and young hermione with piteous moan orestes calls while laodamia near bewails her valiant consort's fate severe adrastus' daughter there laments her spouse sincere and constant to her nuptial vows yet lured by her with gold's seductive aid her lord eriphile to death betray'd and now the baleful anthem loud and long rose in full chorus from the passing throng and love's sad name the cause of all their woes in execrations seem'd the dirge to close but who the number and the names can tell of those that seem'd the deadly strain to swell not men alone but gods my dream display'd celestial wailings fill'd the myrtle shade soft venus with her lover mourn'd the snare the king of shades and proserpine the fair juno whose frown disclosed her jealous spite nor less enthrall'd by love the god of light who held in scorn the wingèd warrior's dart till in his breast he felt the fatal smart each god whose name the learned roman told in cupid's numerous levy seem'd enroll'd and bound before his car in fetters strong in sullen state the thunderer march'd along thus as i view'd th' interminable host the prospect seem'd at last in dimness lost but still the wish remain'd their doom to know as watchful i survey'd the passing show as each majestic form emerged to light thither intent i turn'd my sharpen'd sight and soon a noble pair my notice drew that hand in hand approaching met my view in gentle parley and communion sweet with looks of love they seem'd mine eyes to meet yet strange was their attiretheir tongue unknown spoke them the natives of a distant zone but every doubt my kind assistant clear'd instant i knew them when their names were heard to one encouraged by his aspect mild i spokethe other with a frown recoil'd o masinissathus my speech began by scipio's friendship and the gentle ban of constant love attend my warm request turning around the solemn shade address'd his answer thuswith like desire i glow your lineage name and character to know since you have learnt my name with soft reply i said a name like mine can nought supply the notice of renown like yours to claim no smother'd spark like mine emits a flame to catch the public eye as you can boast a leading name in cupid's numerous host alike his future victims and the past shall own the common tie while time itself shall last but tell me if your guide allow a space the semblance of those tendant shades to trace the names and fortunes of the following pair who seem the noblest gifts of mind to share my name he said you seem to know so well that faithful memory all the rest can tell but as the sad detail may soothe my woes listen while i my mournful doom disclose to rome and scipio's cause my faith was bound e'en lælius scarce a warmer friendship own'd where'er their ensigns fann'd the summer sky i led my libyans on a firm ally propitious fortune still advanced his name yet more than she bestow'd his worth might claim still we advanced and still our glory grew while westward far the roman eagle flew with conquest wing'd but my unlucky star led me unconscious to the fatal snare which love had laid i saw the regal dame our hearts at once confess'd a mutual flame caught by the lure of interdicted joys proudly i scorn'd the stern forbidding voice of roman policy and hoped the vows at hymen's altar sworn might save my spouse but oh that wondrous man who ne'er would yield to passion's call the cruel sentence seal'd that tore my consort from my fond embrace and left me sunk in anguish and disgrace unmoved he saw my briny sorrows flow unmoved he listen'd to my tale of woe but friendship waked at last with reverent awe obsequious own'd his mind's superior law and to that holy and unclouded light that led him on through passion's dubious night submiss i bow'd for oh the beam of day is dark to him that wants her guiding ray love hardly conquer'd long repined in vain when justice link'd the adamantine chain and cruel friendship o'er the conquer'd ground raised with strong hand th' insuperable mound to him i owed my laurels nobly won i loved him as a brother sire and son for in an equal race our lives had run yet the sad price i paid with burning tears dire was the cause that woke my gloomy fears too well the sad result my soul divined too well i knew the unsubmitting mind of sophonisba would prefer the tomb to stern captivity's ignoble doom i too sad victim of celestial wrath was forced to aid the tardy stroke of death with pangs i yielded to her piercing cries to speed her passage to the nether skies and worse than death endured her mind to save from shame more hateful than the yawning grave what was my anguish when she seized the bowl she knows and you whose sympathising soul has felt the fiery shaft may guess my pains now tears and anguish are her sole remains that treasure to preserve my faith to rome those hands committed to th' untimely tomb and every hope and joy of life resign'd to keep the stain of falsehood from my mind but hasten and the moving pomp survey the lightwing'd moments brook no long delay to try if any form your notice claims among those lovelorn youths and amorous dames with poignant grief i heard his tale of woe that seem'd to melt my heart like vernal snow when a low voice these sullen accents sung not for himself but those from whom he sprung he merits fate for i detest them all to whose fell rage i owe my country's fall oh calm your rage unhappy queen i cried twice was the land and sea in slaughter dyed by cruel carthage till the sentence pass'd that laid her glories in the dust at last yet mournful wreaths no less the victors crown'd in deep despair our valour oft they own'd your own impartial annals yet proclaim the punic glory and the roman shame she spokeand with a smile of hostile spite join'd the deep train and darken'd to my sight then as a traveller through lands unknown with care and keen observance journeys on whose dubious thoughts his eager steps retard thus through the files i pass'd with fix'd regard still singling some amid the moving show intent the story of their loves to know a spectre now within my notice came though dubious marks of joy commix'd with shame his features wore like one who gains a boon with secret glee which shame forbids to own o dire example of the demon's power the father leaves the hymeneal bower for his incestuous son the guilty spouse with transport mix'd with honour meets his vows in mournful converse now amidst the host their compact they bewail'd and syria lost instant with eager step i turn'd aside and met the double husband and the bride and with an earnest voice the first address'd a look of dread the spectre's face express'd when first the accents of victorious rome brought to his mind his kingdom's ancient doom at length with many a doleful sigh he said you here behold seleucus' royal shade antiochus is next his life to save my ready hand my beauteous consort gave from me whose will was law a legal prize that bound our souls in everlasting ties indissolubly strong the royal fair forsook a throne to cure the deep despair of him who would have dared the stroke of death to keep without a stain his filial faith a skilful leech the deadly symptoms guess'd his throbbing veins the secret soon confess'd of love with honour match'd in dire debate whenever he beheld my lovely mate else gentle love subdued by filial dread had sent him down among th' untimely dead then like a man that feels a sudden thought his purpose change the mingling crowd he sought and left the question which a moment hung scarce half suppress'd upon my faltering tongue suspended for a moment still i stood with various thoughts oppress'd in musing mood at length a voice was heard the passing day is yours but it permits not long delay i turn'd in haste and saw a fleeting train outnumbering those who pass'd the surging main by xerxes leda naked wailing crew whose wretched plight the drops of sorrow drew from my full eyesof many a clime and tongue commix'd the mournful pageant moved along while scarce the fortunes or the name of one among a thousand passing forms was known i spied that ethiopian's dusky charms which woke in perseus' bosom love's alarms and next was he who for a shadow burn'd which the deceitful watery glass return'd enamour'd of himself in sad decay amid abundance poorhe look'd his life away and now transform'd through passion's baneful power he o'er the margin hangs a drooping

lofty crest then she whose tears the springing fount supplied and she whose form above the rolling tide hangs a portentous cliffthe royal fair who wrote the dictates of her last despair to him whose ships had left the friendly strand with the keen steel in her determined hand there too pygmalion with his newmade spouse with many more i spied whose amorous vows and fates in neverdying song resound where aganippe laves the sacred ground and last of all i saw the lovely maid of love unconscious by an oath betray'd like one by wonder reft of speech i stood pond'ring the mournful scene in pensive mood as one that waits advice my guide in haste beganyou let the moments run to waste what objects hold you heremy doom you know compell'd to wander with the sons of woe oh yet awhile afford your

baneful symphony the song of death he scarce had spoken when a chill presage what warriors feel before the battle's rage when in the angry trump's sonorous breath they hear before it comes the sound of death my heart possess'd and tinged with deadly pale i seem'd escaped from death's eternal jail when fleeting to my side with looks of love a phantom brighter than the cyprian dove my fingers clasp'd which though of power to wield the temper'd sabre in the bloody field against an armed foe a touch subdued and gentle words and looks that fired the blood my friend addressed me i remember well and from his lips these dubious accents fell converse with whom you please for all the train are mark'd alike the slaves of cupid's reign thus in security and peace trepann'd i was enlisted in that wayward band who shortlived joys by anguish long obtain and whom the pleasures of a rival pain more than their proper joys remembrance shows too clear at last the source of all my woes when jealousy and love and envy drew that nurture from my heart by which they grew as feverish eyes on airdrawn features dwell my fascinated eyes by magic spell dwell'd on the heavenly form with ardent look and at a glance the dire contagion took that tinged my days to come and each delight but those that bore her stamp consign'd to night i blush with shame when to my inward view the devious paths return where cupid drew his willing slave with all my hopes and fears when phoebus seem'd to rise and set in tears for many a springand when i used to dwell a lonely hermit in a silent cell how upwards oft i traced the purling rills to their pure fountains in the misty hills the rocks i used to climb the solemn woods where oft i wander'd by the winding floods and often spent whene'er i chanced to stray in amorous ditties all the livelong day what mournful rhymes i wrote and 'rased again spending the precious hours of youth in vain 'twas in this school i learn'd the mystic things of the blind god and all the secret springs from which his hopes and fears alternate rise 'graved on his frontlet the detection lies which all may read for i have oped their eyes and she the cause of all my lengthen'd toils disdains my passion though she boasts my spoils of rigid honour proud she smiles to see the fatal triumph of her charms in me not love himself can aid for love retires and in her sacred presence veils his fires he feels his genius by her looks subdued and all his spells by stronger spells withstood hence my despair for neither force nor art can wound her bosom nor extract the dart that rankles here while proudly she defies the power that makes a captive world his prize she is not one that dallies with the foe but with unconquer'd soul defies the blow and like the lord of light displays afar a splendour which obscures each lesser star her port is all divine her radiant smile and e'en her scorn the captive heart beguile her accents breathe of heaven her auburn hair whether it wanton with the sportive air or bound in shining wreaths adorns her face secures her conquests with resistless grace her eyes that sparkle with celestial fire have render'd me the slave of fond desire but who can raise his style to match her charms what mortal bard can sing the soft alarms that flutter in the breast and fire the veins alas the theme surmounts the loftiest strains far as the ocean in its ample bed exceeds the purling stream that warbles through the mead such charms are hersas never were reveal'd on earth since phoebus first the world beheld and voices tuned her peerless form to praise suffer a solemn pause with mute amaze thus was i manacled for life while she proud of my bonds enjoy'd her liberty with ceaseless suit i pray'd but all in vain one prayer among a thousand scarce could gain a slight regardso hopeless was my state and such the laws of love imposed by fate for stedfast is the rule by nature given which all the ranks of life from earth to heaven with reverent awe and homage due obey and every age and climate owns its sway i know the cruel pangs by lovers borne when from the breast the bleeding heart is torn by love's relentless gripe the deadly harms of cupid when he wields resistless arms or when in dubious truce he drops his dart and gives short respite to the tortured heart the vital current's ebb and flood i know when shame or anger bids the features glow or terror pales the cheek the deadly snake i know that nestles in the flowery brake and watchful seems to sleep and languor feigns when healthinspiring vigour fills the veins i know what hope and fear assail the mind when i pursue my love yet dread to find i know the strange and sympathetic tie when soul in soul transfused a fond ally for ever seems another and the same or change with mutual love their mortal frame from transient smiles to long protracted woe the various turns and dark degrees i know and hot and cold and that unequall'd smart when souls survive though sever'd from the heart i know i cherish and detect the cheat of every hour but still with eager feet and fervent hope pursue the flying fair and still for promised rapture meet despair when absent i consume in raging fire but in her presence check'd the flames expire repress'd by sacred awe the boundless sway of cruel love i feel that makes a prey of all those energies that lift the soul to her congenial climes above the pole i know the various pangs that rend the heart i know that noblest souls receive the dart without defence when reason drops the shield and recreant to her foe resigns the field i saw the archer in his airy flight i saw him when he check'd his arrow's flight and when it reach'd the mark i watched the god and saw him win his way by force or fraud as best befits his ends his whirling throne turns short at will or runs directly on the rapid follies which his axle bear are short fallacious hope and certain fear and many a promise given of halcyon days whose faint and dubious gleam the heart betrays i know what secret flame the marrow fries how in the veins a dormant fever lies till fann'd to fury by contagious breath it gains tremendous head and ends in death i know too well what long and doubtful strife forms the dire tissue of a lover's life the transient taste of sweet commix'd with gall what changes dire the hapless crew befall their strange fantastic habitudes i know their measured groans in lamentable flow when rhymingfits the faltering tongue employ and love sick spasms the mournful muse annoy the smile that like the lightning fleets away the sorrows that for half a life delay like drops of honey in a wormwood bowl drain'd to the dregs in bitterness of soul so fickle fortune in a luckless hour had close consigned me to a tyrant's power who cut the nerves that with elastic force had borne me on in freedom's generous course so i in noble independence bred free as the roebuck in the sylvan glade by passion lured a voluntary slave my ready name to cupid's muster gave and yet i saw their grief and wild despair i saw them blindly seek the fatal snare through winding paths and many an artful maze where cupid's viewless spell the band obeys here as i turn'd my anxious eyes around if any shade i then could see renown'd in old or modern times the bard i spied whose unabated love pursued his bride down to the coast of hades and above his life resign'd the pledge of constant love calling her name in deathalcæus near who sung the joys of love and toils severe was seen with pindar and the teian swain a veteran gay among the youthful train of cupid's hostthe mantuan next i found begirt with bards from age to age renown'd whether they chose in lofty themes to soar or sportive try the muse's lighter lore there soft tibullus walk'd with sulmo's bard and there propertius with catullus shared the meed of lovesome lays the grecian dame with sweeter numbers woke the amorous flame while thus i turn'd around my wondering eyes i saw a noble train with new surprise who seem'd of love in choral notes to sing while all around them breathed elysian spring here alighieri with his love i spied selvaggia guido cino side by side guido who mourn'd the lot that fix'd his name the second of his age in lyric fame two other minstrels there i spied that bore his name renown'd on arno's tuneful shore with them sicilia's bards in elder days match'd with the foremost in poetic praise though now they rank behindsennuccio nigh with gentle franceschino met my eye but soon another tribe of manners strange and uncouth dialect was seen to range along the flowery paths by arnald led in cupid's lore by all the muses bred and master of the thememarsilia's coast and narbonne still his polish'd numbers boast the next i saw with lighter step advance 'twas he that caught a flame at every glance that met his eye with him who shared his name join'd with an arnald of inferior fame next either rambold in procession trod no easy conquest to the winged god the pride of montferrat a peerless dame in many a ditty sung announced his flame and genoa's bard who left his native coast and on marsilia's towers the memory lost of his first time when salem's sacred flame taught him a nobler heritage to claim gerard and peter both of gallic blood and tuneful rudel who in moonstruck mood o'er ocean by a flying image led in the fantastic chase his canvas spread and where he thought his amorous vows to breathe from cupid's bow received the shaft of death there was cabestaing whose unequall'd lays from all his rivals won superior praise hugo was there with almeric renown'd bernard and anselm by the muses crown'd those and a thousand others o'er the field advanced nor javelin did they want or shield the muses form'd their guard and march'd before spreading their long renown from shore to shore the latian band with sympathising woe at last i spied amid the moving show bologna's poet first whose honour'd grave his relics hold beside messina's wave o fickle joys that fleet upon the wind and leave the lassitude of life behind the youth that every thought and movement sway'd of this sad heart is now an empty shade what world contains thee now my tuneful guide whom nought of old could sever from my side what is this lifewhat none but fools esteem a fleeting shadow a romantic dream not far i wander'd o'er the peopled field till socrates and lælius i beheld oh may their holy influence never cease that soothed my heartcorroding pangs to peace unequall'd friends no bard's ecstatic lays nor polish'd prose your deathless name can raise to match your genuine worth o'er hill and dale we pass'd and oft i told my doleful tale disclosing all my wounds end not in vain their sacred presence seem'd to soothe my pain oh may that glorious privilege be mine till dust to dust the final stroke resign my courage they inspired to claim the wreath immortal emblem of my constant faith to her whose name the poet's garland bears yet nought from her for long devoted years i reap'd but cold disdain and fruitless tears but soon a sight ensued that like a spell restrain'd at once my passion's stormy swell but this a loftier muse demands to sing the hallow'd power that pruned the daring wing of that blind force by folly canonized and in the garb of deity disguised yet first the conscious muse designs to tell how i endured and 'scaped his witching spell a subject that demands a muse of fire a glorious theme that phoebus might inspire worthy of homer and the orphean lyre still as along the whirling chariot flew i kept the wafture of his wings in view onward his snowwhite steeds were seen to bound o'er many a steepy hill and dale profound and victims of his rage the captive throng chain'd to the flying wheels were dragg'd along all torn and bleeding through the thorny waste nor knew i how the land and sea he pass'd till to his mother's realm he came at last far eastward where the vext Ægean roars a little isle projects its verdant shores soft is the clime and fruitful is the ground no fairer spot old ocean clips around nor sol himself surveys from east to west a sweeter scene in summer livery drest full in the midst ascends a shady hill where down its bowery slopes a streaming rill in dulcet murmurs flows and soft perfume the senses court from many a vernal bloom mingled with magic which the senses steep in sloth and drug the mind in lethe's deep quenching the spark divinethe genuine boast of man in circe's wave immersed and lost this favour'd region of the cyprian queen received its freighta heavenabandon'd scene where falsehood fills the throne while truth retires and vainly mourns her halfextinguish'd fires vile in its origin and viler still by all incentives that seduce the will it seems elysium to the sons of lust but a foul dungeon to the good and just exulting o'er his slaves the winged god here in a theatre his triumphs show'd ample to hold within its mighty round his captive train from thule's northern bound to far taprobane a countless crowd who to the archer boy adoring bow'd sad fantoms shook above their gorgon wings fantastic longings for unreal things and fugitive delights and lasting woes the summer's biting frost and winter's rose and penitence and grief that dragg'd along the royal lawless pair that poets sung one by his spartan plunder seal'd the doom of hapless troythe other rescued rome beneath as if in mockery of their woe the tumbling flood with murmurs deep and low return'd their wailings while the birds above with sweet aerial descant fill'd the grove and all beside the river's winding bed fresh flowers in gay confusion deck'd the mead painting the sod with every scent and hue that flora's breath affords or drinks the morning dew and many a solemn bower with welcome shade over the dusky stream a shelter made and when the sun withdrew his slanting ray and winter cool'd the fervours of the day then came the genial hours the frequent feast and circling times of joy and balmy rest new day and night were poised in even scale and spring awoke her equinoctial gale and progne now and philomel begun with genial toils to greet the vernal sun just theno hapless mortals that rely on fickle fortune's everchanging sky e'en in that season when with sacred fire dan cupid seem'd his subjects to inspire that warms the heart and kindles in the look and all beneath the moon obey his yoke i saw the sad reverse that lovers own i heard the slaves beneath their bondage groan i saw them sink beneath the deadly weight and the long tortures that forerun their fate sad disappointments there in meagre forms were seen and feverish dreams and fancied harms and fantoms rising from the yawning tomb were seen to muster in the gathering gloom around the car and some were seen to climb while cruel fate reversed their steps sublime and empty notions in the port were seen and baffled hopes were there with cloudy mien there was expensive gain and gain that lost and amorous schemes by fortune's favour cross'd and wearisome repose and cares that slept there was the semblance of disgrace that kept the youth from dire mischance on whom it fell and glory darken'd on the gloom of hell perfidious loyalty and honest fraud and wisdom slow and headlong thirst of blood the dungeon where the flowery paths decoy the painful hard escape with long annoy i saw the smooth descent the foot betray and the steep rocky path that leads again to day there in the gloomy gulf confusion storm'd and moody rage its wildest freaks perform'd and settled grief was there and solid night but rarely broke with fitful gleams of light from joy's fantastic hand not vulcan's forge when his cyclopean caves the fumes disgorge nor the deep mine of mongibel that throws the fiery tempest o'er eternal snows nor lipari whose strong sulphureous blast o'ercanopies with flames the watery waste nor stromboli that sweeps the glowing sky with red combustion with its rage could vie little he loves himself that ventures there for there is ceaseless woe and fell despair yet in this dolorous dungeon long confined till time had grizzled o'er my locks i pined there dreaming still of liberty to come i spent my summers in this noisome gloom yet still a dubious joy my grief controll'd to spy such numbers in that darksome hold but soon to gall my seeming transport turn'd and my illustrious partner's fate i mourn'd and often seem'd with sympathising woe to melt in solvent tears like vernal snow i turn'd away but with inverted glance perused the fleeting shapes that fill'd my trance like him that feels a moment's short delight when a fine picture fleets before his sight when to one yoke at once i saw the height of gods and men subdued by cupid's might i took example from their cruel fate and by their sufferings eased my own hard state since phoebus and leander felt like pain the one a god the other but a man one snare caught juno and the carthage dame her husband's death prepared her funeral flame 'twas not a cause that virgil maketh one i need not grieve that unprepared alone unarm'd and young i did receive a wound or that my enemy no hurt hath found by love or that she clothed him in my sight and took his wings and marr'd his winding flight no angry lions send more hideous noise from their beat breasts nor clashing thunder's voice rends heaven frights earth and roareth through the air with greater force than love had raised to dare encounter her of whom i write and she as quick and ready to assail as he enceladus when etna most he shakes nor angry scylla nor charybdis makes so great and frightful noise as did the shock of this first doubtful battle none could mock such earnest war all drew them to the height to see what 'mazed their hearts and dimm'd their sight victorious love a threatening dart did show his right hand held the other bore a bow the string of which he drew just by his ear no leopard could chase a frighted deer free or broke loose with quicker speed than he made haste to wound fire sparkled from his eye i burn'd and had a combat in my breast glad t' have her company yet 'twas not best methought to see her lost but 'tis in vain t' abandon goodness and of fate complain virtue her servants never will forsake as now 'twas seen she could resistance make no fencer ever better warded blow nor pilot did to shore more wisely row to shun a shelf than with undaunted power she waved the stroke of this sharp conqueror mine eyes and heart were watchful to attend in hope the victory would that way bend it ever did and that i might no more be barr'd from her as one whose thoughts before his tongue hath utter'd them you well may see writ in his looks oh if you victor be great sir said i let her and me be bound both with one yoke i may be worthy found and will not set her free doubt not my faith when i beheld her with disdain and wrath so fill'd that to relate it would demand a better muse than mine her virtuous hand had quickly quench'd those gilded fiery darts which dipp'd in beauty's pleasure poison hearts neither camilla nor the warlike host that cut their breasts could so much valour boast nor cæsar in pharsalia fought so well as she 'gainst him who pierceth coats of mail all her brave virtues arm'd attended there a glorious troop and marched pair by pair honour and blushes first in rank the two religious virtues make the second row by those the other women doth excel prudence and modesty the twins that dwell together both were lodgèd in her breast glory and perseverance ever blest fair entertainment providence without sweet courtesy and pureness round about respect of credit fear of infamy grave thoughts in youth and what not oft agree true chastity and rarest beauty these all came 'gainst love and this the heavens did please and every generous soul in that full height he had no power left to bear the weight a thousand famous prizes hardly gain'd she took and thousand glorious palms obtained shook from his hands the fall was not more strange of hannibal when fortune pleased to change her mind and on the roman youth bestow the favours he enjoy'd nor was he so amazed who frighted the israelitish host struck by the hebrew boy that quit his boast nor cyrus more astonish'd at the fall the jewish widow gave his general as one that sickens suddenly and fears his life or as a man ta'en unawares in some base act and doth the finder hate just so was he or in a worse estate fear grief and shame and anger in his face were seen no troubled seas more rage the place where huge typhoeus groans nor etna when her giant sighs were moved as he was then i pass by many noble things i see to write them were too hard a task for me to her and those that did attend i go her armour was a robe more white than snow and in her hand a shield like his she bare who slew medusa a fair pillar there of jasp was next and with a chain first wet in lethe flood of jewels fitly set diamonds mix'd with topazes of old 'twas worn by ladies now 'tis not first hold she caught then bound him fast then such revenge she took as might suffice my thoughts did change and i who wish'd him victory before was satisfied he now could hurt no more i cannot in my rhymes the names contain of blessèd maids that did make up her train calliope nor clio

arrows lie split on the ground and pull'd his plumes away from off his wings after virginia near her vex'd father arm'd with wrath and hate fury and iron and love he freed the state and her from slavery with a manly blow next were those barbarous women who could show they judged it better die than suffer wrong to their rude chastity the wise and strong the chaste hebræan judith follow'd these the greek that saved her honour in the seas with these and other famous souls i see her triumph over him who used to be master of all the world among the rest the vestal nun i spied who was so bless'd as by a wonder to preserve her fame next came hersilia the roman dame or sabine rather with her valorous train who prove all slanders on that sex are vain then 'mongst the foreign ladies she whose faith t' her husband not Æneas caused her death the vulgar ignorant may hold their peace her safety to her chastity gave place dido i mean whom no vain passion led as fame belies her last the virtuous

and did avernus leave on the one hand on th' other sybil's cave so to linternus march'd the village where the noble africane lies buried there the great news of her triumph did appear as glorious to the eye as to the ear the fame had been and the most chaste did show most beautiful it grieved love much to go another's prisoner exposed to scorn who to command whole empires seemèd born thus to the chiefest city all were led entering the temple which sulpicia made sacred it drives all madness from the mind and chastity's pure temple next we find which in brave souls doth modest thoughts beget not by plebeians enter'd but the great patrician dames there were the spoils display'd of the fair victress there her palms she laid and did commit them to the tuscan youth whose marring scars bear witness of his truth with others more whose names i fully knew my guide instructed me that overthrew the power of love 'mongst whom of all the rest hippolytus and joseph were the best when gods and men i saw in cupid's chain promiscuous led a long uncounted train by sad example taught i learn'd at last wisdom's best ruleto profit from the past some solace in the numbers too i found of those that mourn'd like me the common wound that phoebus felt a mortal beauty's slave that urged leander through the wintry wave that jealous juno with eliza shared whose more than pious hands the flame prepared that mix'd her ashes with her murder'd spouse a dire completion of her nuptial vows for not the trojan's love as poets sing in her wan bosom fix'd the secret string and why should i of common ills complain shot by a random shaft a thoughtless swain unarm'd and unprepared to meet the foe my naked bosom seem'd to court the blow one cause at least to soothe my grief ensued when i beheld the ruthless power subdued and all unable now to twang the string or mount the breeze on manycolour'd wing but never tawny monarch of the wood his raging rival meets athirst for blood nor thunderclouds when winds the signal blow with louder shock astound the world below when the red flash insufferably bright heaven earth and sea displays in dismal light could match the furious speed and fell intent with which the wingèd son of venus bent his fatal yew against the dauntless fair who seem'd with heart of proof to meet the war nor etna sends abroad the blast of death when wrapp'd in flames the giant moves beneath nor scylla roaring nor the loud reply of mad charybdis when her waters fly and seem to lave the moon could match the rage of those fierce rivals burning to engage aloof the many drew with sudden fright and clamber'd up the hills to see the fight and when the tempest of the battle grew each face display'd a wan and earthy hue the assailant now prepared his shaft to wing and fixed his fatal arrow on the string the fatal string already reach'd his ear nor from the leopard flies the trembling deer with half the haste that his ferocious wrath bore him impetuous on to deeds of death and in his stern regard the scorching fire was seen that burns the breast with fierce desire to me a fatal flame but hope to see my lovely tyrant forced to love like me and bound in equal chain assuaged my woe as with an eager eye i watch'd the coming blow but virtue as it ne'er forsakes the soul that yields obedience to her blest control proves how of her unjustly we complain when she vouchsafes her gracious aid in vain in vain the selfabandon'd shift the blame upon their stars or fate's perverted name ne'er did a gladiator shun the stroke with nimbler turn or more attentive look never did pilot's hand the vessel steer with more dexterity the shoals to clear than with evasion quick and matchless art by grace and virtue arm'd in head and heart she wafted quick the cruel shaft aside woe to the lingering soul that dares the stroke abide i watch'd and long with firm expectance stood to see a mortal by a god subdued the usual fate of man in hope to find the cords of love the beauteous captive bind with me a willing slave to cupid's car the fortunes of the common race to share as one whose secrets in his looks we spy his inmost thoughts discovers in his eye or in his aspect graved by nature's hand my gestures ere i spoke enforced my fond demand oh link us to your wheels aloud i cried if your victorious arms the fray decide oh bind us closely with your strongest chain i ne'er will seek for liberty again but oh what fury seem'd his eyes to fill no bard that ever quaff'd castalia's rill could match his frenzy when his shafts of fire with magic plumed and barb'd with hot desire short of their sacred aim innoxious fell extinguish'd by the pure ethereal spell camilla or the amazons in arms from ancient thermodon to fierce alarms inured or julius in pharsalia's field when his dread onset forced the foe to yield came not so boldly on as she to face the mighty victor of the human race who scorns the temper'd mail and buckler's ward with her the virtues camean heavenly guard a skydescended legion clad in light of glorious panoply contemning mortal might all weaponless they came but hand in hand defied the fury of the adverse band honour and maiden shame were in the ban elysian twins beloved by god and man her delegates in arms with them combined prudence appear'd the daughter of the mind pure temperance next and steadiness of soul that ever keeps in view the eternal goal and gentleness and soft address were seen and courtesy with mild inviting mien and purity and cautious dread of blame with ardent love of clear unspotted fame and sage discretion seldom seen below where the full veins with youthful ardour glow benevolence and harmony of soul were there but rarely found from pole to pole and there consummate beauty shone combined with all the pureness of an angelmind such was the host that to the conflict came their bosoms kindling with empyreal flame and sense of heavenly helpthe beams that broke from each celestial file with horror struck the bowyer god who felt the blinding rays and like a mortal stood in fix'd amaze while on his spoils the fair assailants flew and plunder'd at their ease the captive crew and some with palmy boughs the way bestrew'd to show their conquest o'er the baffled god sudden as hannibal on zama's field was forced to scipio's conquering arms to yield sudden as david's hand the giant sped when accaron beheld his fall and fled sudden as her revenge who gave the word when her stern guards dispatch'd the persian lord or like a man that feels a strong disease his shivering members in a moment seize such direful throes convulsed the despot's frame his hands that veil'd his eyes confess'd his shame and mental pangs more agonising far in his sick bosom bred a civil war and hate and anguish with insatiate ire flash'd in his eyes with momentary fire not raging ocean when its billows boil nor typhon when he lifts the trembling soil of arima his tortured limbs to ease nor etna thundering o'er the subject seas surpass'd the fury of the baffled power who stamp'd with rage and bann'd the luckless hour scenes yet unsung demand my loftiest lays but oh the theme transcends a mortal's praise a sweet but humbler subject may suffice to muster in my song her fair allies but first her arms and vesture claim my song before i chant the fair attendant throng a robe she wore that seem'd of woven light the buckler of minerva fill'd her right medusa's bane a column there was drawn of jasper bright and o'er the snowy lawn and round her beauteous neck a chain was slung which glittering on her snowy bosom hung diamond and topaz there with mingled ray return'd in varied hues the beam of day a treasure of inestimable cost too long alas in lethe's bosom lost to modern matrons scarcely known by fame few were it to be found the prize would claim with this the vanquish'd god she firmly bound while i with joy her kind assistance own'd but oh the feeble muse attempts in vain to celebrate in song her numerous train not all the choir of aganippe's spring the pageant of the sisterhood could sing but some shall live distinguished in my lay the most illustrious of the long array the dexter wing the fair lucretia led with her who faithful to her nuptial bed her suitors scorn'd and these with dauntless hand the quiver seized and scatter'd on the strand the pointless arrows and the broken bow of cupid their despoil'd and recreant foe lovely virginia with her sire was nigh paternal love and anger in his eye beam'd terrible while in his hand he show'd aloft the dagger tinged with virgin blood which freedom on the maid and rome at once bestow'd then the teutonic dames a dauntless race who rush'd on death to shun a foe's embrace and judith chaste and fair but void of dread who the hot blood of holofernes shed and that fair greek who chose a watery grave her threaten'd purity unstain'd to save all these and others to the combat flew and all combined to wreak the vengeance due on him whose haughty hand in days of yore from clime to clime his conquering standard bore another troop the vestal virgin led who bore along from tyber's oozy bed his liquid treasure in a sieve to show the falsehood of her base calumnious foe by wondrous proofand there the sabine queen with all the matrons of her race was seen renown'd in records oldand next in fame was she who dauntless met the funeral flame not wrong'd in love but to preserve her vows immaculate to her sidonian spouse let others of Æneas' falsehood tell how by an unrequited flame she fell a nobler though a selfinflicted doom caused by connubial love dismiss'd her to the tomb picarda next i saw who vainly tried to pass her days on arno's flowery side in single purity till force compell'd the virgin to the marriage bond to yield the triumph seem'd at last to reach the shore where lofty baise hears the tuscan roar 'twas on a vernal morn it touch'd the land and 'twixt mount barbaro that crowns the strand and old avernus once an hallow'd ground for the cumæan sibyl's cell renown'd linterno's sandy bounds it reach'd at last great scipio's favour'd haunt in ages past famed africanus whose victorious blade the slaughterous deeds of hannibal repaid and to his country's heart a bloody passage made here in a calm retreat his life he spent with rural peace and solitude content and here the flying rumour sped before and magnified the deed from shore to shore the pageant when it reach'd the destined spot seem'd to exceed their utmost reach of thought there all distinguish'd by their deeds of arms excell'd the rest in more than mortal charms nor he whom oft the steeds of conquest drew disdained another's triumphs to pursue at the metropolis arrived at last to fair sulpicia's temples soon we pass'd sacred to chastity to ward the pest with which her sensual foes inflame the breast the patroness of noble dames alone then was the fair plebeian pole unknown the victress here display'd her martial spoils and here the laurel hung that crown'd her toils a guard she stationed on the temple's bound the tuscan mark'd with many a glorious wound suspicion in the jealous breast to cure with him a chosen squadron kept the door i heard their names and i remember well the youthful greek that by his stepdame fell and him who kept by heaven's command in awe refused to violate the nuptial law the glorious maid whose soul to heaven is gone and left the rest cold earth she who was grown a pillar of true valour and had gain'd much honour by her victory and chain'd that god which doth the world with terror bind using no armour but her own chaste mind a fair aspect coy thoughts and words well weigh'd sweet modesty to these gave friendly aid it was a miracle on earth to see the bow and arrows of the deity and all his armour broke who erst had slain such numbers and so many captive ta'en the fair dame from the noble sight withdrew with her choice companythey were but few and made a little troop true virtue's rare yet each of them did by herself appear a theme for poems and might well incite the best historian they bore a white unspotted ermine in a field of green about whose neck a topaz chain was seen set in pure gold their heavenly words and gait express'd them blest were born for such a fate bright stars they seem'd she did a sun appear who darken'd not the rest but made more clear their splendour honour in brave minds is found this troop with violets and roses crown'd cheerfully march'd when lo i might espy another ensign dreadful to mine eye a lady clothed in black whose stern looks were with horror fill'd and did like hell appear advanced and said you who are proud to be so fair and young yet have no eyes to see how near you are your end behold i am she whom they fierce and blind and cruel name who meet untimely deaths 'twas i did make greece subject and the roman empire shake my piercing sword sack'd troy how many rude and barbarous people are by me subdued many ambitious vain and amorous thought my unwish'd presence hath to nothing brought now am i come to you while yet your state is happy ere you feel a harder fate on these you have no power she then replied who had more worth than all the world beside and little over me but there is one who will be deeply grieved when i am gone his happiness doth on my life depend i shall find freedom in a peaceful end as one who glancing with a sudden eye some unexpected object doth espy then looks again and doth his own haste blame so in a doubting pause this cruel dame a little stay'd and said the rest i call to mind and know i have o'ercome them all then with less fierce aspect she said thou guide of this fair crew hast not my strength assay'd let her advise who may command prevent decrepit age 'tis but a punishment from me this honour thou alone shalt have without or fear or pain to find thy grave as he shall please who dwelleth in the heaven and rules on earth such portion must be given to me as others from thy hand receive she answered then afar we might perceive millions of dead heap'd on th' adjacent plain no verse nor prose may comprehend the slain did on death's triumph wait from india from spain and from morocco from cathay and all the skirts of th' earth they gather'd were who had most happy lived attended there popes emperors nor kings no ensigns wore of their past height but naked show'd and poor where be their riches where their precious gems their mitres sceptres robes and diadems o miserable men whose hopes arise from worldly joys yet be there few so wise as in those trifling follies not to trust and if they be deceived in end 'tis just ah more than blind what gain you by your toil you must return once to your mother's soil and aftertimes your names shall hardly know nor any profit from your labour grow all those strange countries by your warlike stroke submitted to a tributary yoke the fuel erst of your ambitious fire what help they now the vast and bad desire of wealth and power at a bloody rate is wickedbetter bread and water eat with peace a wooden dish doth seldom hold a poison'd draught glass is more safe than gold but for this theme a larger time will ask i must betake me to my former task the fatal hour of her short life drew near that doubtful passage which the world doth fear another company who had not been freed from their earthy burden there were seen to try if prayers could appease the wrath or stay th' inexorable hand of death that beauteous crowd convened to see the end which all must taste each neighbour every friend stood by when grim death with her hand took hold and pull'd away one only hair of gold thus from the world this fairest flower is ta'en to make her shine more bright not out of spleen how many moaning plaints what store of cries were utter'd there when fate shut those fair eyes for which so oft i sung whose beauty burn'd my tortured heart so long while others mourn'd she pleased and quiet did the fruit enjoy of her blest life farewell without annoy true saint on earth said they so might she be esteem'd but nothing bates death's cruelty what shall become of others since so pure a body did such heats and colds endure and changed so often in so little space ah worldly hopes how blind you be how base if since i bathe the ground with flowing tears for that mild soul who sees it witness bears and thou who read'st mayst judge she fetter'd me the sixth of april and did set me free on the same day and month oh how the way of fortune is unsure none hates the day of slavery or of death so much as i abhor the time which wrought my liberty and my too lasting life it had been just my greater age had first been turn'd to dust and paid to time and to the world the debt i owed then earth had kept her glorious state now at what rate i should the sorrow prize i know not nor have heart that can suffice the sad affliction to relate in verse of these fair dames that wept about her hearse courtesy virtue beauty all are lost what shall become of us none else can boast such high perfection no more we shall hear her wise words nor the angelical sweet music of her voice while thus they cried the parting spirit doth itself divide with every virtue from the noble breast as some grave hermit seeks a lonely rest the heavens were clear and all the ambient air without a threatening cloud no adversaire 'durst once appear or her calm mind affright death singly did herself conclude the fight after when fear and the extremest plaint were ceased th' attentive eyes of all were bent on that fair face and by despair became secure she who was spent not like a flame by force extinguish'd but as lights decay and undiscerned waste themselves away thus went the soul in peace so lamps are spent as the oil fails which gave them nourishment in sum her countenance you still might know the same it was not pale but white as snow which on the tops of hills in gentle flakes falls in a calm or as a man that takes desir'ed rest as if her lovely sight were closed with sweetest sleep after the sprite was gone if this be that fools call to die death seem'd in her exceeding fair to be and now closed in the last hour's narrow span of that so glorious and so brief career ere the dark pass so terrible to man and a fair troop of ladies gather'd there still of this earth with grace and honour crown'd to mark if ever death remorseful were this gentle company thus throng'd around in her contemplating the awful end all once must make by law of nature bound each was a neighbour each a sorrowing friend then death stretch'd forth his hand in that dread hour from her bright head a golden hair to rend thus culling of this earth the fairest flower nor hate impell'd the deed but pride to dare assert o'er highest excellence his power what tearful lamentations fill the air the while those beauteous eyes alone are dry whose sway my burning thoughts and lays declare and while in grief dissolved all weep and sigh she in meek silence joyous sits secure gathering already virtue's guerdon high depart in peace o mortal goddess pure they said and such she was although it nought 'gainst mightier death avail'd so sternso sure alas for others if a few nights wrought in her each change of suffering dust below oh hope how false how blind all human thought whether in earth sank deep the dews of woe for the bright spirit that had pass'd away think ye who listen they who witness'd know 'twas the first hour of april the sixth day that bound me and alas now sets me free how fortune doth her fickleness display none ever grieved for loss of liberty or doom of death as i for freedom grieve and life prolong'd who only ask to die due to the world it had been her to leave and me of earlier birth to have laid low nor of its pride and boast the age bereave how great the grief it is not mine to show scarce dare i think still less by numbers try or by vain speech to ease my weight of woe virtue is dead beauty and courtesy the sorrowing dames her honour'd couch around for what are we reserved in anguish cry where now in woman will all grace be found who with her wise and gentle words be blest and drink of her sweet song th' angelic sound the spirit parting from that beauteous breast in its meek virtues wrapt and best prepared had with serenity the heavens imprest no power of darkness with ill influence dared within a space so holy to intrude till death his terrible triumph had declared then hush'd was all lament all fear subdued each on those beauteous features gazed intent and from despair was arm'd with fortitude as a pure flame that not by force is spent but faint and fainter softly dies away pass'd gently forth in peace the soul content and as a light of clear and steady ray when fails the source from which its brightness flows she to the last held on herwonted way pale was she no but white as shrouding snows that when the winds are lull'd fall silently she seem'd as one o'erwearied to repose e'en as in balmy slumbers lapt to lie the spirit parted from the form below in her appear'd what th' unwise term to die and death sate beauteous on her beauteous brow the nightthat follow'd the disastrous blow which my spent sun removed in heaven to glow and left me here a blind and desolate man now far advanced to spread o'er earth began the sweet spring dew which harbingers the dawn when slumber's veil and visions are withdrawn when crown'd with oriental gems and bright as newborn day upon my tranced sight my lady lighted from her starry sphere with kind speech and soft sigh her hand so dear so long desired in vain to mine she press'd while heavenly sweetness instant warm'd my breast remember her who from the world apart kept all your course since known to that young heart pensive she spoke with mild and modest air seating me by her on a soft bank where in greenest shade the beech and laurel met remember ah how should i e'er forget yet tell me idol mine in tears i said live youor dreamt iis is laura dead live i i only live but you indeed are dead and must be till the last best hour shall free you from the flesh and vile world's power but our brief leisure lest desire exceed turn we ere breaks the day already nigh to themes of greater interest pure and high then i when ended the brief dream and vain that men call life by you now safely pass'd is death indeed such punishment and pain replied she while on earth your lot is cast slave to the world's opinions blind and hard true happiness shall ne'er your search reward death to the good a dreary prison opes but to the vile and base who all their hopes and cares below have fix'd is full of fear and this my loss now mourn'd with many a tear would seem a gain and knew you my delight boundless and pure your joyful praise excite thus spoke she and on heaven her grateful eye devoutly fix'd but while her roselips lie chain'd in cold silence i renew'd my theme lightning and storm red battle age disease backs prisons poison faminemake not these death even to the bravest bitter seem she answer'd i deny not that the strife is great and sore which waits on parting life and then of death eternal the sharp dread but if the soul with hope from heaven be fed and haply in itself the heart have grief what then is death its brief sigh brings relief already i approach'd my final goal my strength was failing on the wing my soul when thus a low sadwhisper by my side 'o miserable who to vain life tied counts every hour and deems each hour a day by land or ocean to himself a prey where'er he wanders who one form pursues indulges one desire one dream renews thought speech sense feeling there for ever bound' it ceased and to the spot whence came the sound i turn'd my languid eyes and her beheld your love who check'd my pity who impell'd i recognised her by that voice and air so often which had chased my spirit's gloom now calm and wise as courteous then and fail but e'en to you when dearest in the bloom of joyous youth and beauty's rosy prime theme of much thought and muse of many a rhyme believe me life to me was far less sweet than thus a merciful mild death to meet the blessed hope to mortals rarely given and such joy smooth'd my path from earth to heaven as from long exile to sweet home i turn'd while but for you alone my soul with pity yearn'd but tell me lady said i by that true and loyal faith on earth well known to you now better known before the omniscient's face if in your breast the thought e'er found a place love prompted my long martyrdom to cheer though virtue follow'd still her fair emprize for ah oft written in those sweetest eyes dear anger dear disdain and pardon dear long o'er my wishes doubts and shadows cast scarce from my lips the venturous speech had pass'd when o'er her fair face its old sunsmile beam'd my sinking virtue which so oft redeem'd and with a tender sigh she answer'd never can or did aught from you my firm heart sever but as to our young fame no other way direct and plain of mutual safety lay i temper'd with cold looks your raging flame so fondest mothers wayward children tame how often have i said 'it me behoves to act discreetly for he burns not loves who hopes and fears ill plays discretion's part he must not in my face detect my heart' 'twas this which as a rein the generous horse slack'd your hot haste and shaped your proper course often while love my struggling heart consumed has anger tinged my cheek my eyes illumed for love in me could reason ne'er subdue but ever if i saw you sorrowspent instant my fondest looks on you were bent myself from shame from death redeeming you or if the flame of passion blazed too high my greeting changed with short speech and cold eye my sorrow moved you or my terror shook that these the arts i used the way i took smiles varying scorn as sunshine follows rain you know and well have sung in many a deathless strain again and oft as saw i sunk in grief those tearful eyes i said 'without relief surely and swift he marches to his grave' and at the thought the fitting help i gave' but if i saw you wild and passion spurr'd prompt with the curb your boldness i deterr'd thus cold and kind pale blushing gloomy gay safe have i led you through the dangerous way and as my labour great my joy at last trembling i answer'd and my tears flow'd fast lady could i the blessed thought believe my faithful love would full reward receive o man of little faithher fairest cheek e'en as she spoke a warm blush 'gan to streak why should i say it were it less than true if you on earth were pleasant in my view i need not ask enough it pleased to see the best love of that true heart fix'd on me well too your genius pleased me and the fame which far and wide it shower'd upon my name your love had blame in its excess alone and wanted prudence while you sought to tell by act and air what long i knew and well to the whole world your secret heart was shown thence was the coldness which your hopes distress'd for such our sympathy in all the rest as is alone where love keeps honour's law since in your bosom first its birth i saw one fire our heart has equally inflamed except that i conceal'd it you proclaim'd and louder as your cry for mercy swell'd terror and shame my silence more compell'd that men my great desire should little think but ah concealment makes not sorrow less complaint embitters not the mind's distress feeling with fiction cannot swell and shrink but surely then at least the veil was raised you only present when your verse i praised and whispering sang 'love dares not more to say' yours was my heart though turn'd my eyes away grieve you as cruel that their grace was such as kept the little gave the good and much yet oft and openly as they withdrew far oftener furtively they dwelt on you for pity thus what prudence robb'd return'd and ever so their tranquil lights had burn'd save that i fear'd those dear and dangerous eyes might then the secret of my soul surprise but one thing more that ere our parley cease memory may shrine my words as treasures sweet and this our parting give your spirit peace in all things else my fortune was complete in this alone some cause had i to mourn that first i saw the light in humble earth and still in sooth it grieves that i was born far from the flowery nest where you had birth yet fair to me the land where your love bless'd haply that heart which i alone possess'd elsewhere had others loved myself unseen and i now voiced by fame had there inglorious been ah no i cried howe'er the spheres might roll wherever born immutable and whole in life in death my great love had been yours enough she smiled its fame for aye endures and all my own but pleasure has such power too little have we reck'd the growing hour behold aurora from her golden bed brings back the day to mortals and the sun already from the ocean lifts his head alas he warns me that my mission done we here must part if more remain to say sweet friend in speech be brief as must my stay then i this kindest converse makes to me all sense of my long suffering light and sweet but lady for that now my life must be hateful and heavy tell me i entreat when late or early we again shall meet if right i read the future long must you without me walk the earth she spoke and pass'd from view when cruel death his paly ensign spread over that face which oft in triumph led my subject thoughts and beauty's sovereign light retiring left the world immersed in night the phantom with a frown that chill'd the heart seem'd with his gloomy pageant to depart exulting in his formidable arms and proud of conquest o'er seraphic charms when turning round i saw the power advance that breaks the gloomy grave's eternal trance and bids the disembodied spirit claim the glorious guerdon of immortal fame like phosphor in the sullen rear of night before the golden wheels of orient light he came but who the tendant pomp can tell what mighty master of the corded shell can sing how heaven above accordant smiled and what bright pageantry the prospect fill'd i look'd but all in vain the potent ray flash'd on my sight intolerable day at first but to the splendour soon inured my eyes perused the pomp with sight assured true dignity in every face was seen as on they march'd with more than mortal mien and some i saw whom love had link'd before ennobled now by virtue's lofty lore cæsar and scipio on the dexter hand of the bright goddess led the laurell'd band one like a planet by the lord of day seem'd o'erillumined by her splendid ray by brightness hid for he to virtue true his mind from love's soft bondage nobly drew the other half a slave to female charms parted his homage to the god of arms and love's seductive power but close and deep like files that climb'd the capitolian steep in years of yore along the sacred way a martial squadron came in long array in ranges as they moved distinct and bright on every burganet that met the light some name of long renown distinctly read o'er each majestic brow a glory shed still on the noble pair my eyes i bent and watch'd their progress up the steep ascent the second scipio next in line was seen and he that seem'd the lure of egypt's queen with many a mighty chief i there beheld whose valorous hand the battle's storm repell'd two fathers of the great cornelian name with their three noble sons who shared their fame one singly march'd before and hand in hand his two heroic partners trod the strand the last was first in fame but brighter beams his follower flung around in solar streams metaurus' champion whom the moon beheld when his resistless spears the current swell'd with libya's hated gore in arms renown'd was he nor less with wisdom's olive crown'd quick was his thought and ready was his hand his power accomplish'd what his reason plann'd he seem'd with eagle eye and eagle wing sudden on his predestined game to spring but he that follow'd next with step sedate drew round his foe the viewless snare of fate while with consummate art he kept at bay the raging foe and conquer'd by delay another fabius join'd the stoic pair the pauli and marcelli famed in war with them the victor in the friendly strife whose public virtue quench'd his love of life with either brutus ancient curius came fabricius too i spied a nobler name with his plain russet gown and simple board than either lydian with her golden hoard then came the great dictator from the plough and old serranus show'd his laurell'd brow marching with equal step camillus near who fresh and vigorous in the bright career of honour sped and never slack'd his pace till death o'ertook him in the noble race and placed him in a sphere of fame so high that other patriots fill'd a lower sky even those ungrateful lands that seal'd his doom recall'd the hanish'd man to rescue rome torquains nigh a sterner spectre stood his fasces all besmear'd with filial blood he childless to the shades resolved to go rather than rome a moment should forego that dreadful discipline whose rigid lore had spread their triumphs round from shore to shore then the two decii came by heaven inspired divinely bold as when the foe retired before their heavendirected march amazed when on the selfdevoted men they gazed till they provoked their fate and curtius nigh as when to heaven he cast his upward eye and all on fire with glory's opening charms plunged to the shades below with clanging arms lævinus mummius with flaminius show'd like meaner lights along the heavenly road and he who conquer'd greece from sea to sea then mildly bade th' afflicted race be free next came the dauntless envoy with his wand whose more than magic circle on the sand the frenzy of the syrian king confined o'erawed he stood and at his fate repined great manlius too who drove the hostile throng prone from the steep on which his members hung a sad reverse the hungry vultures' food when roman justice claim'd his forfeit blood then cocles came who took his dreadful stand where the wide arch the foaming torrent spann'd stemming the tide of war with matchless might and turn'd the heady current of the fight and he that stung with fierce vindictive ire consumed his erring hand with hostile fire duillius next and catulus were seen whose daring navies plough'd the billowy green that laves pelorus and the sardian shore and dyed the rolling waves with punic gore great appius next advanced in sterner mood who with patrician loftiness withstood the clamours of the crowd but close behind of gentler manners and more equal mind came one perhaps the first in martial might yet his dim glory cast a waning light but neither bacchus nor alcmena's son such trophies yet by east or west have won nor he that in the arms of conquest died as he when rome's stern foes his valour tried yet he survived his fame but luckier far was one that follow'd next whose golden star to better fortune led and mark'd his name among the first in deeds of martial fame but cruel was his rage and dipp'd in gore by civil slaughter was the wreath he wore a lessensanguined laurel graced the head of him that next advanced with lofty tread in martial conduct and in active might of equal honour in the fields of fight then great volumnius who expell'd the pest whose spreading ills the romans long distress'd rutilius cassus philo next in sight appear'd like twinkling stars that gild the night three men i saw advancing up the vale mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail dentatus long in standing fight renown'd sergius and scæva oft with conquest crown'd the triple terror of the hostile train on whom the storm of battle broke in vain another sergius near with deep disgrace marr'd the long glories of his ancient race marius then the cimbrians who repell'd from fearful rome and lybia's tyrant quell'd and fulvius who campania's traitors slew and paid ingratitude with vengeance

agamemnon with the spartan's shade one by his spouse forsaken one betray'd and now another spartan met my view who cheerly call'd his selfdevoted crew to banquet with the ghostly train below and with

let the nobler temple of the mind to ruin fall by love's alluring sway seduced from duty's hallow'd path astray then he that on the flaming hill survived that sight no mortal else beheld and lived the eternal one and heard with awe profound that awful voice that shakes the globe around with him who check'd the sun in mid career and stopp'd the burning wheels that mark the sphere as a wellmanaged steed his lord obeys and at the straiten'd rein his course delays and still the flying war the tide of day pursued and show'd their bands in wild dismay victorious faith to thee belongs the prize in

stretching far my sight amid the train that hid in countless crowds the shaded plain good hezekiah met my raptured sight and manoah's son a prey to female sleight and he whose eye foresaw the coming flood with mighty nimrod nigh a man of blood whose pride the heavendefying tower design'd but sin the rising fabric undermined great maccabeus next my notice claim'd by love to zion's broken laws inflamed who rush'd to arms to save a sinking state scorning the menace of impending fate now satiate with the view my languid sight had fail'd but soon perceived with new delight a train like heaven's descending powers appear whose radiance seem'd my cherish'd sight to clear there march'd in rank the dames of ancient days antiope renown'd for martial praise orithya near in glittering armour shone and fair hippolyta that wept her son the sisters whom alcides met of yore in arms on thermodon's distinguish'd shore when he and theseus foil'd the warlike pair by force compell'd the nuptial rite to share the widow'd queen who seem'd with tranquil smile to view her son upon the funeral pile but brooding vengeance rankled deep within so cyrus fell within the fatal gin misconduct which from age to age convey'd o'er her long glories cast a funeral shade i saw the amazon whom ilion mourn'd and her for whom the flames of discord burn'd betwixt the trojan and rutulian train when her affianced lover press'd the plain and her that with dishevell'd tresses flew halfarm'd halfclad her rebels to subdue her partner too in lawless love i spied a roman harlot an incestuous bride but tadmor's queen with nobler fires inflamed the pristine glory of the sex reclaim'd who in the spring of life in beauty's bloom her heart devoted to her husband's tomb true to his dust aspiring to the crown of virtue in such years but seldom known with temper'd mail she hid her snowy breast and with bellona's helm and nodding crest despising cupid's lore her charms conceal'd and led the foes of latium to the field the shock at ancient rome was felt afar and tyber trembled at the distant war of foes she held in scorn but soon she found that mars his native tribes with conquest crown'd and by her haughty foes in triumph led the last warm tears of indignation shed o fair bethulian can my vagrant song o'erpass thy virtues in the nameless throng when he that sought to lure thee to thy shame paid with his sever'd head his frantic flame can ninus be forgot whose ancient name begins the long roll of imperial fame and he whose pride by heaven's imperial doom reduced among the grazing herd to

baleful star that o'er euphrates led the storm of war thy troops by parthian snares encircled round mark'd with hesperia's shame the bloody ground and mithridates rome's incessant foe who fled through burning plains and tracts of snow their fell pursuit but now the parting strain must pass with slight survey the coming train there british arthur seeks his share of fame and three cæsarian victors join their claim one from the race of libya one from spain and last not least the pride of fair lorraine with his twelve noble peers goffredo's powers direct their march to salem's sacred towers and plant his throne beneath the asian skies a sacred seat that now neglected lies ye lords of christendom eternal shame for ever will pursue each royal name and tell your wolfish rage for kindred blood while paynim hounds profane the seat of god with him the christian glory seem'd to fall the rest was hid behind oblivion's pall save a few honour'd names inferior far in peace to guide or point the storm of war yet e'en among the stranger tribes were found a few selected names in song renown'd first mighty saladin his country's boast the scourge and terror of the baptized host noradin and lancaster fierce in arms who vex'd the gallic coast with long alarms i look'd around with painful search to spy if any martial form should meet my eye familiar to my sight in worlds above the willing objects of respect or love and soon a wellknown face my notice drew sicilia's king to whose sagacious view the scenes of deep futurity display'd their birth through coming time's disclosing shade there my colonna too with glad surprise 'mid the pale group assail'd my startled eyes his noble soul was all alive to fame yet holy friendship mix'd her softer claim which in his bosom fix'd her lasting throne with charity that makes the wants of all her own still on the warrior band i fix'd my view but now a different troop my notice drew the sage palladian tribe a nobler train whose toils deserve a more exalted strain plato majestic in the front appear'd where wisdom's sacred hand her ensign rear'd celestial blazonry by heaven bestow'd which waving high before the vaward glow'd then came the stagyrite whose mental ray pierced through all nature like the shafts of day and he that by the unambitious name lover of wisdom chose to bound his fame then socrates and xenophon were seen with them a bard of more than earthly mien whom every muse of jove's immortal choir bless'd with a portion of celestial fire from ancient argos to the phrygian bound his neverdying strains were borne around on inspiration's wing and hill and dale echoed the notes of ilion's mournful tale the woes of thetis and ulysses' toils his mighty mind recover'd from the spoils of envious time and placed in lasting light the trophies ransom'd from oblivion's night the mantuan bard responsive to his song corival of his glory walk'd along the next with new surprise my notice drew where'er he pass'd spontaneous flowerets grew fit emblems of his style and close behind the great athenian at his lot repined which doom'd him like a secondary star to yield precedence in the wordy war though like the bolts of jove that shake the spheres he lighten'd in their eyes and thunder'd in their ears the assembly felt the shock the immortal sound his attic rival's fainter accents drown'd but now so many candidates for fame in countless crowds and gay confusion came that memory seem'd her province to resign perplex'd and lost amid the lengthen'd line yet solon there i spied for laws renown'd salubrious plants in clean and cultured ground but noxious if malignant hands infuse in their transmuted stems a baneful juice amongst the romans varro next i spied the light of linguists and our country's pride still nearer as he moved the eye could trace a new attraction and a nameless grace livy i saw with dark invidious frown listening with pain to sallust's loud renown and pliny there profuse of life i found whom love of knowledge to the burning bound led unawares and there plotinus' shade who dark platonic truths in fuller light display'd he flying far to 'scape the coming pest was when he seem'd secure by death oppressed that fix'd by fate before he saw the sun the careful sophist strove in vain to shun hortensius crassus galba next appear'd calvus and antony by rome revered the first with pollio join'd whose tongue profane assail'd the fame of cicero in vain thucydides who mark'd distinct and clear the tardy round of many a bloody year and with a master's graphic skill pourtray'd the fields whose summer dust with blood was laid and near herodotus his ninefold roll display'd father of history and euclid's vest the heaventaught symbols of that art express'd that measures matter form and empty space and calculates the planets' heavenly race and porphyry whose proud obdurate heart was proof to mighty truth's celestial dart with sophistry assail'd the cause of god and stood in arms against the heavenly code hippocrates for healing arts renown'd and half obscured within the dark profound the pair whom ignorance in ancient days adorn'd like deities with borrow'd rays galen was near of pergamus the boast whose skill retrieved the art so nearly lost then anaxarchus came who conquer'd pain and he whom pleasures strove to lure in vain from duty's path and first in mournful mood the mighty soul of archimedes stood and sage democritus i there beheld whose daring hand the light of vision quell'd to shun the soulseducing forms that play on the rapt fancy in the beam of day the gifts of fortune too he flung aside by wisdom's wealth a nobler store supplied there hippias too i saw who dared to claim for general science an unequall'd name and him whose doubtful mind and roving eye no certainty in truth itself could spy with him who in a deep mysterious guise her heavenly charms conceal'd from vulgar eyes the frontless cynic next in rank i saw sworn foe to decency and nature's modest law with him the sage that mark'd with dark disdain his wealth consumed by rapine's lawless train and glad that nothing now remain'd behind to foster envy in a rival's mind that treasure bought which nothing can destroy the soul's calm sunshine and the heartfelt joy then curious dicaearchus met my view who studied nature with sagacious view quintilian next and seneca were seen and chaeronea's sage of placid mien all various in their taste and studious toils but each adorn'd with learning's splendid spoils there too i saw in universal jar the tribes that spend their time in wordy war and o'er the vast interminable deep of knowledge like conflicting tempests sweep for truth they never toil but feed their pride with fuel by eternal strife supplied no dragon of the wild with equal rage nor lions in nocturnal war engage with hate so deadly as the learn'd and wise who scan their own desert with partial eyes carneades renown'd for logic skill who right or wrong and true and false at will could turn and change employ'd his fruitless pain to reconcile the fierce contending train but ever as he toil'd the raging pest of pride as knowledge grew with equal speed increased then epicurus of sinister fame rebellious to the lord of nature came who studied to deprive the soaring soul of her bright world of hope beyond the pole a moleey'd race their hapless guide pursued and blindly still the vain assault renew'd dark metrodorus next sustain'd the cause with aristippus true to pleasure's laws chrysippus next his subtle web disposed zeno alternate spread his hand and closed to show how eloquence expands the soul and logic boasts a close and nervous whole and there cleanthes drew the mighty line that led his pupils on with heart divine through time's fallacious joys by virtue's road to the bright palace of the sovereign good but here the weary muse forsakes the throng too numerous for the bounds of mortal song behind aurora's wheels the rising sun his voyage from his golden shrine begun with such ethereal speed as if the hours had caught him slumb'ring in her rosy bowers with lordly eye that reach'd the world's extreme methought he look'd when gliding on his beam that wingèd power approach'd that wheels his car in its wide annual range from star to star measuring vicissitude till now more near methought these thrilling accents met my ear new laws must be observed if mortals claim spite of the lapse of time eternal fame those laws have lost their force that heaven decreed and i my circle run with fruitless speed if fame's loud breath the slumb'ring dust inspire and bid to live with neverdying fire my power that measures mortal things is cross'd and my long glories in oblivion lost if mortals on yon planet's shadowy face can match the tenor of my heavenly race i strive with fruitless speed from year to year to keep precedence o'er a lower sphere in vain yon flaming coursers i prepare in vain the watery world and ambient air their vigour feeds if thus with angels' flight a mortal can o'ertake the race of light were you a lesser planet doom'd to run a shorter journey round a nobler sun ranging among yon dusky orbs below a more degrading doom i could not know now spread your swiftest wings my steeds of flame we must not yield to man's ambitious aim with emulation's noblest fires i glow and soon that reptile race that boast below bright fame's conducting lamp that seems to vie with my incessant journeys round the sky and gains or seems to gain increasing light yet shall its glories sink in gradual night but i am still the same my course began before that dusky orb the seat of man was built in ambient air with constant sway i lead the grateful change of night and day to one ethereal track for ever bound and ever treading one eternal round and now methought with more than mortal ire he seem'd to lash along his steeds of fire and shot along the air with glancing ray swift as a falcon darting on its prey no planet's swift career could match his speed that seem'd the power of fancy to exceed the courier of the sky i mark'd with dread as by degrees the baseless fabric fled that human power had built while high disdain i felt within to see the toiling train striving to seize each transitory thing that fleets away on dissolution's wing and soonest from the firmest grasp recede like airy forms with tantalizing speed o mortals ere the vital powers decay or palsied eld obscures the mental ray raise your affections to the things above which time or fickle chance can never move had you but seen what i despair to sing how fast his courser plied the flaming wing with unremitted speed the soaring mind had left his low terrestrial cares behind but what an awful change of earth and sky all in a moment pass'd before my eye now rigid winter stretch'd her brumal reign with frown gorgonean over land and main and flora now her gaudy mantle spread and many a blushing rose adorn'd her bed the momentary seasons seem'd to fleet from bright solstitial dews to winter's driving sleet in circle multiform and swift career a wondrous tale untold to mortal ear before yet reason's calm unbiass'd view must soon pronounce the seeming fable true when deep remorse for many a wasted spring still haunts the frighted soul on demon wing fond hope allured me on with meteor flight and love my fancy fed with vain delight chasing through fairy fields her pageants gay but now at last a clear and steady ray from reason's mirror sent my folly shows and on my sight the hideous image throws of what i ama mind eclipsed and lost by vice degraded from its noble post but yet e'en yet the mind's elastic spring buoys up my powers on resolution's wing while on the flight of time with rueful gaze intent i try to thread the backward maze and husband what remains a scanty space few fleeting hours alas have pass'd away since a weak infant in the lap i lay for what is human life but one uncertain day now hid by flying vapours dark and cold and brighten'd now with gleams of sunny gold that mock the gazer's eye with gaudy show and leave the victim to substantial woe yet hope can live beneath the stormy sky and empty pleasures have their pinions ply and frantic pride exalts the lofty brow nor marks the snares of death that lurk below uncertain whether now the shaft of fate sings on the wind or heaven prolongs my date i see my hours run on with cruel speed and in my doom the fate of all i read a certain doom which nature's self must feel when the dread sentence checks the mundane wheel go court the smiles of hope ye thoughtless crew her fairy scenes disclose an ample view to brainless men but wisdom o'er the field casts her keen glance and lifts her beamy shield to meet the point of fate that flies afar and with stern vigilance expects the war perhaps in vain my admonitions fall yet still the muse repeats the solemn call nor can she see unmoved your senses drown'd by circe's deadly spells in sleep profound she cannot see the flying seasons roll in dread succession to the final goal and sweep the tribes of men so fast away to stygian darkness or eternal day with unconcernoh yet the doom repeal before your callous hearts forget to feel e'er penitence foregoes her fruitless toil or hell's black regent claims his human spoil oh haste before the fatal arrows fly that send you headlong to the nether sky when down the gulf the sons of folly go in sad procession to the seat of woe thus deeply musing on the rapid round of planetary speed in thought profound i stood and long bewail'd my wasted hours my vain afflictions and my squander'd powers when in deliberate march a train was seen in silent order moving o'er the green a band that seem'd to hold in high disdain the desolating power of time's resistless reign their names were hallow'd in the muse's song wafted by fame from age to age along high o'er oblivion's deep devouring wave where millions find an unrefunding grave with envious glance the changeful power beheld the glorious phalanx which his power repell'd and faster now the fiery chariot flew while fame appear'd the rapid flight to rue and labour'd some to save but close behind i heard a voice which like the western wind that whispers softly through the summer shade these solemn accents to mine ear convey'd man is a falling flower and fame in vain strives to protract his momentaneous reign beyond his bounds to match the rolling tide on whose dread waves the long olympiads ride till fed by time the deep procession grows and in long centuries continuous flows for what the power of ages can oppose though tempe's rolling flood or hebrus claim renown they soon shall live an empty name where are their heroes now and those who led the files of war by xanthus' gory bed or tuscan tyber's more illustrious band whose conquering eagles flew o'er sea and land what is renowna gleam of transient light that soon an envious cloud involves in night while passing time's malignant hands diffuse on many a noble name pernicious dews thus our terrestrial glories fade away our triumphs pass the pageants of a day our fields exchange their lords our kingdoms fall and thrones are wrapt in hades' funeral pall yet virtue seldom gains what vice had lost and oft the hopes of good desert are cross'd not wealth alone but mental stores decay and like the gifts of mammon pass away nor wisdom wealth nor fortune can withstand his desolating march by sea and land nor prayers nor regal power his wheels restrain till he has ground us down to dust again though various are the titles men can plead some for a time enjoy the glorious meed that merit claims yet unrelenting fate on all the doom pronounces soon or late and whatsoe'er the vulgar think or say were not your lives thus shorten'd to a day your eyes would see the consummating power his countless millions at a meal devour and reason's voice my stubborn mind subdued conviction soon the solemn words pursued i saw all mortal glory pass away like vernal snows beneath the rising ray and wealth and power and honour strive in vain to 'scape the laws of time's despotic reign though still to vulgar eyes they seem to claim a lot conspicuous in the lists of fame transient as human joys to feeble age they love to linger on this earthly stage and think it cruel to be call'd away on the faint morn of life's disastrous day yet ah how many infants on the breast by heaven's indulgence sink to endless rest and oft decrepid age his lot bewails whom every ill of lengthen'd life assails hence sick despondence thinks the human lot a gift of fleeting breath too dearly bought but should the voice of fame's obstreperous blast from ages on to future ages last e'en to the trump of doomhow poor the prize whose worth depends upon the changing skies what time bestows and claims the fleeting breath of fame is but at best a second death a death that none of mortal race can shun that wastes the brood of time and triumphs o'er the sun when all beneath the ample cope of heaven i saw like clouds before the tempest driven in sad vicissitude's eternal round awhile i stood in holy horror bound and thus at last with selfexploring mind musing i ask'd what basis i could find to fix my trust an inward voice replied trust to the almighty he thy steps shall guide he never fails to hear the faithful prayer but worldly hope must end in dark despair now what i am and what i was i know i see the seasons in procession go with still increasing speed while things to come unknown unthought amid the growing gloom of long futurity perplex my soul while life is posting to its final goal mine is the crime who ought with clearer light to watch the winged years' incessant flight and not to slumber on in dull delay till circling seasons bring the doomful day but grace is never slow in that i trust to wake the mind before i sink to dust with those strong energies that lift the soul to scenes unhoped unthought above the pole while thus i ponder'd soon my working thought once more that everchanging picture brought of sublunary things before my view and thus i question'd with myself anew what is the end of this incessant flight of life and death alternate day and night when will the motion on these orbs impress'd sink on the bosom of eternal rest at once as if obsequious to my will another prospect shone unmoved and still eternal as the heavens that glow'd above a wide resplendent scene of light and love the wheels of phoebus from the zodiac turn'd no more the nightly constellations burn'd green earth and undulating ocean roll'd away by some resistless power controll'd immensity conceived and brought to birth a grander firmament and more luxuriant earth what wonder seized my soul when first i view'd how motionless the restless racer stood whose flying feet with winged speed before still mark'd with sad mutation sea and shore no more he sway'd the future and the past but on the moveless present fix'd at last as at a goal reposing from his toils like earth unclothed of all its vernal foils unvaried scene where neither change nor fate nor care nor sorrow can our joys abate nor finds the light of thought resistance here more than the sunbeams in a crystal sphere but no material things can match their flight in speed excelling far the race of light oh what a glorious lot shall then be mine if heaven to me these nameless joys assign for there the sovereign good for ever reigns nor evil yet to come nor present pains no baleful birth of time its inmates fear that comes the burthen of the passing year no solar chariot circles through the signs and now too near and now too distant shines to wretched man and earth's devoted soil dispensing sad variety of toil oh happy are the blessed souls that sing loud hallelujahs in eternal ring thrice happy he who late at last shall find a lot in the celestial climes assign'd he led by grace the auspicious ford explores where cross the plains the wintry torrent roars that troublous tide where with incessant strife weak mortals struggle through and call it life in love with vanity oh doubly blind are they that final consolation find in things that fleet on dissolution's wing or dance away upon the transient ring of seasons as they roll no sound they hear from that still voice that wisdom's sons revere no vestment they procure to keep them warm against the menace of the wintry storm but all exposed in naked nature lie a shivering crowd beneath the inclement sky of reason void by every foe subdued selfruin'd selfdeprived of sovereign good reckless of him whose universal sway matter and all its various forms obey whether they mix in elemental strife or meet in married calm and foster life his nature baffles all created mind in earth or heaven to fathom or to find one glimpse of glory on the saints bestow'd with eager longings fills the courts of god for deeper views in that abyss of light while mortals slumber here content with night though nought we find below the moon can fill the boundless cravings of the human will and yet what fierce desire the fancy wings to gain a grasp of perishable things although one fleeting hour may scatter far the fruit of many a year's corroding care those spacious regions where our fancies roam pain'd by the past expecting ills to come in some dread moment by the fates assign'd shall pass away nor leave a rack behind and time's revolving wheels shall lose at last the speed that spins the future and the past and sovereign of an undisputed throne awful eternity shall reign alone then every darksome veil shall fleet away that hides the prospects of eternal day those cloudborn objects of our hopes and fears whose airdrawn forms deluded memory bears as of substantial things away so fast shall fleet that mortals at their speed aghast watching the change of all beneath the moon shall ask what once they were and will be soon the time will come when every change shall cease this quick revolving wheel shall rest in peace no summer then shall glow nor winter freeze nothing shall be to come and nothing past but an eternal now shall ever last though time shall be no more yet space shall give a nobler theatre to love and live the wingèd courier then no more shall claim the power to sink or raise the notes of fame or give its glories to the noontide ray true merit then in everlasting day shall shine for ever as at first it shone at once to god and man and angels known happy are they who in this changing sphere already have begun the bright career that reaches to the goal which all in vain the muse would blazon in her feeble strain but blest above all other blest is he who from the trammels of mortality ere half the vital thread ran out was free mature for heaven where now the matchless fair preserves those features that seraphic air and all those mental charms that raised my mind to judge of heaven while yet on earth confined that soft attractive glance that won my heart when first my bosom felt unusual smart now beams now glories in the realms above fed by the eternal source of light and love then shall i see her as i first beheld but lovelier far and by herself excell'd and i distinguish'd in the bands above shall hear this plaudit in the choirs of love lo this is he who sung in mournful strains for many years a lover's doubts and pains yet in this soulexpanding sweet employ a sacred transport felt above all vulgar joy she too shall wonder at herself to hear her praises ring around the radiant sphere but of that hour it is not mine to know to her perhaps the period of my woe is manifest for she my fate may find in the pure mirror of the eternal mind to me it seems at hand a sure presage denotes my rise from this terrestrial stage then what i gain'd and lost below shall lie suspended in the balance of the sky and all our anxious sublunary cares shall seem one tissue of arachne's snares and all the lying vanities of life the sordid source of envy hate and strife ignoble as they are shall then appear before the searching beam of truth severe then souls from sense refined shall see the fraud that led them from the living way of god from the dark dungeon of the human breast all direful secrets then shall rise confess'd in honour multiplieda dreadful show to hierarchies above and saints below eternal reason then shall give her doom and sever'd wide the tenants of the tomb shall seek their portions with instinctive haste quick as the savage speeds along the waste then shall the golden hoard its trust betray and they that mindless of that dreadful day boasted their wealth its vanity shall know in the dread avenue of endless woe while they whom moderation's wholesome rule kept still unstain'd in virtue's heavenly school who the calm sunshine of the soul beneath enjoy'd will share the triumph of the faith these pageants five the world and i beheld the sixth and last i hope in heaven reveal'd if heaven so will when time with speedy hand the scene despoils and death's funereal wand the triumph leads but soon they both shall fall under that mighty hand that governs all while they who toil for true renown below whom envious time and death a mightier foe relentless plunged in dark oblivion's womb when virtue seem'd to seek the silent tomb spoil'd of her heavenly charms once more shall rise regain their beauty and assert the skies leaving the dark sojourn of time beneath and the wide desolated realms of death but she will early seek these glorious bounds whose longlamented fall the world resounds in unison with me and heaven will view that awful day her heavenly charms renew when soul with body joins gebenna's strand saw me enroll'd in love's devoted band and mark'd my toils through many hard campaigns and wounds whose scars my memory yet retains blest is the pile that marks the hallow'd dust there at the resurrection of the just when the last trumpet with earthshaking sound shall wake her sleepers from their couch profound then when that spotless and immortal mind in a material mould once more enshrined with wonted charms shall wake seraphic love how will the beatific sight improve her heavenly beauties in the climes above happy those souls who now are on their way or shall hereafter to attain that end theme of my argument come when it will and 'midst the other fair and fraught with grace most happy she whom death has snatch'd away on this side far the natural bound of life the angel manners then will clearly shine the meet and pure discourse the chasten'd thought which nature planted in her youthful breast unnumber'd beauties worn by time and death shall then return to their best state of bloom and how thou hast bound me love will then be seen whence i by every finger shall be shown behold who ever wept and in his tears was happier far than others in their smiles and she of whom i yet lamenting sing shall wonder at her own transcendant charms seeing herself far above all admired here peaceful sleeps the chaste the happy shade of that pure spirit which adorn'd this earth pure fame true beauty and transcendent worth rude stone beneath thy rugged breast are laid death sudden snatch'd the dear lamented maid who first to all my tender woes gave birth woes that estranged my sorrowing soul to mirth while full four lustres time completely made sweet plant that nursed on avignon's sweet soil there bloom'd there died when soon the weeping muse threw by the lute forsook her wonted toil bright spark of beauty that still fires my breast what pitying mortal shall a prayer refuse that heaven may number thee amid the blest here rest the chaste the dear the blest remains of her most lovely peerless while on earth what late was beauty spotless honour worth stern marble here thy chill embrace retains the freshness of the laurel death disdains and hath its root thus

pen and muse and genius lies o lovely beauteous limbs o vivid fire that even in death hast power to melt the soul heaven be thy portion peace with god on high whether we write or speak or do but look we are ever unapparent what we are cannot be transfused into word or book our soul from us is infinitely far however much we give our thoughts the will to be our soul and gesture it abroad our hearts are incommunicable still in what we show ourselves we are ignored the abyss from soul to soul cannot be bridged by any skill of thought or trick of seeming unto our very selves we are abridged when we would utter to our thought our being we are our dreams of ourselves souls by gleams and each to each other dreams of others’ dreams if that apparent part of life’s delight our tingled fleshsense circumscribes were seen by aught save reflex and cocarnal sight joy flesh and life might prove but a gross screen haply truth’s body is no eyable being appearance even as appearance lies haply our close dark vague warm sense of seeing is the choked vision of blindfolded eyes wherefrom what comes to thought’s sense of life nought all is either the irrational world we see or some aughtelse whose beingunknown doth rot its use for our thought’s use whence taketh me a qualmlike ache of life a bodydeep soulhate of what we seek and what we weep when i do think my meanest line shall be more in time’s use than my creating whole that future eyes more clearly shall feel me in this inked page than in my direct soul when i conjecture put to make me seeing good readers of me in some aftertime thankful to some idea of my being that doth not even my with gone true soul rime an anger at the essence of the world that makes this thus or thinkable this wise takes my soul by the throat and makes it hurled in nightly horrors of despaired surmise and i become the mere sense of a rage that lacks the very words whose waste might ’suage i could not think of thee as piecèd rot yet such thou wert for thou hadst been long dead yet thou liv’dst entire in my seeing thought and what thou wert in me had never fled nay i had fixed the moments of thy beauty thy ebbing smile thy kiss’s readiness and memory had taught my heart the duty to know thee ever at that deathlessness but when i came where thou wert laid and saw the natural flowers ignoring thee sans blame and the encroaching grass with casual flaw framing the stone to age where was thy name i knew not how to feel nor what to be towards thy fate’s material secrecy how can i think or edge my thoughts to action when the miserly press of each day’s need aches to a narrowness of spilled distraction my soul appalled at the world’s work’s timegreed how can i pause my thoughts upon the task my soul was born to think that it must do when every moment has a thought to ask to fit the immediate craving of its cue the coin i’d heap for marrying my muse and build our home i’th’ greater timetobe becomes dissolved by needs of each day’s use and i feel beggared of infinity like a truechristian sinner each day fleshdriven by his own act to forfeit his wished heaven as a bad orator badly o’erbookskilled doth overflow his purpose with made heat and like a clock winds with withoutness willed what should have been an inner instinct’s feat or as a prosewit harshly poet turned lacking the subtler music in his measure with useless care labours but to be spurned courting in alien speech the muse’s pleasure i study how to love or how to hate estranged by consciousness from sentiment with a thought feeling forced to be sedate even when the feeling’s nature is violent as who would learn to swim without the river when nearest to the trick as far as ever thy words are torture to me that scarce grieve thee that entire death shall null my entire thought and i feel torture not that i believe thee but that i cannot disbelieve thee not shall that of me that now contains the stars be by the very contained stars survived thus were fate all unjust yet what truth bars an all unjust fate’s truth from being believed conjecture cannot fit to the seen world a garment of its thought untorn or covering or with its stuffed garb forge an otherworld without itself its dead deceit discovering so all being possible an idle thought may less idle thoughts selfknown no truer dismay how many masks wear we and undermasks upon our countenance of soul and when if for selfsport the soul itself unmasks knows it the last mask off and the face plain the true mask feels no inside to the mask but looks out of the mask by comasked eyes whatever consciousness begins the task the task’s accepted use to sleepness ties like a child frighted by its mirrored faces our souls that children are being thoughtlosing foist otherness upon their seen grimaces and get a whole world on their forgot causing and when a thought would unmask our soul’s masking itself goes not unmasked to the unmasking oh to be idle loving idleness but i am idle all in hate of me ever in action’s dream in the false stress of purposed action never set to be like a fierce beast selfpenned in a baitlair my will to act binds with excess my action notacting coils the thought with raged despair and acting rage doth paint despair distraction like someone sinking in a treacherous sand each gesture to deliver sinks the more the struggle avails not and to raise no hand though but more slowly useless we’ve no power hence live i the dead life each day doth bring repurposed for next day’s repurposing as to a child i talked my heart asleep with empty promise of the coming day and it slept rather for my words made sleep than from a thought of what their sense did say for did it care for sense would it not wake and question closer to the morrow’s pleasure would it not edge nearer my words to take the promise in the meting of its measure so if it slept ’twas that it cared but for the present sleepy use of promised joy thanking the fruit but for the forecome flower which the less active senses best enjoy thus with deceit do i detain the heart of which deceit’s self knows itself a part like to a ship that storms urge on its course by its own trials our soul is surer made the very things that make the voyage worse do make it better its peril is its aid and as the storm drives from the storm our heart within the peril disimperilled grows a port is near the more from port we part the port whereto our driven direction goes if we reap knowledge to crossprofit this from storms we learn when the storm’s height doth drive that the black presence of its violence is the pushing promise of near far blue skies learn we but how to have the pilotskill and the storm’s very might shall mate our will as the lone frighted user of a nightroad suddenly turns round nothing to detect yet on his fear’s sense keepeth still the load of that brinknothing he doth but suspect and the cold terror moves to him more near of something that from nothing casts a spell that when he moves to fright more is not there and’s only visible when invisible so i upon the world turn round in thought and nothing viewing do no courage take but my more terror from no seen cause got to that felt corporate emptiness forsake and draw my sense of mystery’s horror from seeing no mystery’s mystery alone when i should be asleep to mine own voice in telling thee how much thy love’s my dream i find me listening to myself the noise of my words othered in my hearing them yet wonder not this is the poet’s soul i could not tell thee well of how i love loved i not less by knowing it were all my self my love and no thought love to prove what consciousness makes more by consciousness it makes less for it makes it less itself my sense of love could not my love richdress did it not for it spend love’s own lovepelf poet’s love’s this as in these words i prove thee i love my love for thee more than i love thee we are born at sunset and we die ere morn and the whole darkness of the world we know how can we guess its truth to darkness born the obscure consequence of absent glow only the stars do teach us light we grasp their scattered smallnesses with thoughts that stray and though their eyes look through night’s complete mask yet they speak not the features of the day why should these small denials of the whole more than the black whole the pleased eyes attract why what it calls «worth» does the captive soul add to the small and from the large detract so put of light’s love wishing it night’s stretch a nightly thought of day we darkly reach like a bad suitor desperate and trembling from the mixed sense of being not loved and loving who with feared longing half would know dissembling with what he’d wish proved what he fears soon proving i look with inner eyes afraid to look yet perplexed into looking at the worth this verse may have and wonder of my book to what thoughts shall’t in alien hearts give birth but as he who doth love and loving hopes yet hoping fears fears to put proof to proof and in his mind for possible proofs gropes delaying the true proof lest the real thing scoff i daily live i’th’ fame i dream to see but by my thought of others’ thought of me we never joy enjoy to that full point regret doth wish joy had enjoyèd been nor have the strength regret to disappoint recalling not past joy’s thought but its mien yet joy was joy when it enjoyèd was and afterenjoyed when as joy recalled it must have been joy ere its joy did pass and recalled joy still since its beingpast galled alas all this is useless for joy’s in enjoying not in thinking of enjoying its mere thoughtmirroring gainst itself doth sin by mere reflecting solid life destroying yet the more thought we take to thought to prove it must not think doth further from joy move my love and not i is the egoist my love for thee loves itself more than thee ay more than me in whom it doth exist and makes me live that it may feed on me in the country of bridges the bridge is more real than the shores it doth unsever so in our world all of relation this is truethat truer is love than either lover this thought therefore comes lightly to doubt’s door if we seeing substance of this world are not mere intervals god’s absence and no more hollows in real consciousness and thought and if ’tis possible to thought to bear this fruit why should it not be possible to truth indefinite space which by cosubstance night in one black mystery two void mysteries blends the stray stars whose innumerable light repeats one mystery till conjecture ends the stream of time known by birthbursting bubbles the gulf of silence empty even of nought thought’s highwalled maze which the outed owner troubles because the string’s lost and the plan forgot when i think on this and that here i stand the thinker of these thoughts emptily wise holding up to my thinking my thinghand and looking at it with thoughtalien eyes the prayer of my wonder looketh past the universal darkness lone and vast beauty and love let no one separate whom exact nature did to each other fit giving to beauty love as finishing fate and to love beauty as true colour of it let he but friend be who the soul finds fair but let none love outside the body’s thought so the seen couple’s togetherness shall bear truth to the beauty each in the other sought i could but love thee out of mockery of love and thee and mine own ugliness therefore thy beauty i sing and wish not thee thanking the gods i long not out of place lest like a slave that for kings’ robes doth long obtained shall with mere wearing do them wrong when in the widening circle of rebirth to a new flesh my travelled soul shall come and try again the unremembered earth with the old sadness for the immortal home shall i revisit these same differing fields and cull the old new flowers with the same sense that some small breath of foiled remembrance yields of more age than my days in this pretence shall i again regret strange faces lost of which the present memory is forgot and but in unseen bulks of vagueness tossed out of the closed sea and black night of thought were thy face one what sweetness will’t not be though by blind feeling to remember thee thought was born blind but thought knows what is seeing its careful touch deciphering forms from shapes still suggests form as aught whose proper being mere finding touch with erring darkness drapes yet whence except from guessed sight does touch teach that touch is but a close and empty sense how does mere touch selfuncontented reach for some truer sense’s whole intelligence the thing once touched if touch be now omitted stands yet in memory real and outward known so the untouching memory of touch is fitted with sense of a sense whereby far things are shown so by touch of untouching wrongly aright touch’ thought of seeing sees not things but sight my soul is a stiff pageant man by man of some egyptian art than egypt older found in some tomb whose rite no guess can scan where all things else to coloured dust did moulder whate’er its sense may mean its age is twin to that of priesthoods whose feet stood near god when knowledge was so great that ’twas a sin and man’s mere soul too man for its abode but when i ask what means that pageant i and would look at it suddenly i lose the sense i had of seeing it nor can try again to look nor hath my memory a use that seems recalling save that it recalls an emptiness of having seen those walls even as upon a low and clouddomed day when clouds are one cloud till the horizon our thinking senses deem the sun away and say «’tis sunless» and «there is no sun» and yet the very day they wrong truth by is of the unseen sun’s effluent essence the very words do give themselves the lie the very thought of absence comes from presence even so deem we through good of what is evil he speaks of light that speaks of absent light and absent god becoming present devil is still the absent god by essence’ right the withdrawn cause by being withdrawn doth get being thereby cause still the denied effect something in me was born before the stars and saw the sun begin from far away our yellow local day on its wont jars for it hath communed with an absolute day through my thought’s night as a worn robe’s heard trail that i have never seen i drag this past that saw the possible like a dawn grow pale on the lost night before it mute and vast it dates remoter than god’s birth can reach that had no birth but the world’s coming after so the world’s to me as after whispered speech the causeignored sudden echoing of laughter that ’t has a meaning my conjecture knows but that ’t has meaning’s all its meaning shows we are in fate and fate’s and do but lack outness from soul to know ourselves its dwelling and do but compel fate aside or back by fate’s own immanence in the compelling we are too far in us from outward truth to know how much we are not what we are and live but in the heat of error’s youth yet young enough its acting youth to ignore the doubleness of mind fails us to glance at our exterior presence amid things sizing from otherness our countenance and seeing our puppet will’s actacting strings an unknown language speaks in us which we are at the words of fronted from reality the world is woven all of dream and error and but one sureness in our truth may lie that when we hold to aught our thinking’s mirror we know it not by knowing it thereby for but one side of things the mirror knows and knows it colded from its solidness a double lie its truth is what it shows by true show’s false and nowhere by true place thought clouds our life’s daysense with strangeness yet never from strangeness more than that it’s strange doth buy our perplexed thinking for we get but the words’ sense from wordsknowledge truth change we know the world is false not what is true yet we think on knowing we ne’er shall know how yesterday is long ago the past is a fixed infinite distance from today and bygone things the firstlived as the last in irreparable sameness far away how the tobe is infinitely ever out of the place wherein it will be now like the seen wave yet far up in the river which reaches not us but the newwaved flow this thing time is whose being is having none the equable tyrant of our different fates who could not be bought off by a shattered sun or tricked by new use of our careful dates this thing time is that to the gravewill bear my heart sure but of it and of my fear the edge of the green wave whitely doth hiss upon the wetted sand i look yet dream surely reality cannot be this somehow somewhere this surely doth but seem the sky the sea this great extent disclosed of outward joy this bulk of life we feel is not something but something interposed only what in this is not this is real if this be to have sense if to be awake be but to see this bright great sleep of things for the rarer potion mine own dreams i’ll take and for truth commune with imaginings holding a dream too bitter a too fair curse this common sleep of men the universe my weary life that lives unsatisfied on the foiled offbrink of being e’er but this to whom the power to will hath been denied and the will to renounce doth also miss my sated life with having nothing sated in the motion of moving poisèd aye within its dreams from its own dreams abated this life let the gods change or take away for this endless succession of empty hours like deserts after deserts voidly one doth undermine the very dreaming powers and dull even thought’s active inaction tainting with foreunwilled will the dreamed act twice thus removed from the unobtained fact i do not know what truth the false untruth of this sad sense of the seen world may own or if this flowered plant bears also a fruit unto the true reality unknown but as the rainbow neither earth’s nor sky’s stands in the dripping freshness of lulled rain a hope not real yet not fancy’s lies athwart the moment of our ceasing pain somehow since pain is felt yet felt as ill hope hath a better warrant than being hoped since pain is felt as aught we should not feel man hath a nature’s reason for having groped since time was time and age and grief his measures towards a better shelter than time’s pleasures i am older than nature and her time by all the timeless age of consciousness and my adult oblivion of the clime where i was born makes me not countryless ay and dim through my daylight thoughts escape yearnings for that land where my childhood dreamed which i cannot recall in colour or shape but haunts my hours like something that hath gleamed and yet is not as light remembered nor to the left or to the right conceived and all round me tastes as if life were dead and the world made but to be disbelieved thus i my hope on unknown truth lay yet how but by hope do i the unknown truth get when i have sense of what to sense appears sense is sense ere ’tis mine or mine in me is when i hear hearing ere i do hear hears when i see before me abstract seeing sees i am part soul part i in all i touch soul by that part i hold in common with all and i the spoiled part that doth make sense such as i can err by it and my sense mine call the rest is wondering what these thoughts may mean that come to explain and suddenly are gone like messengers that mock the message’ mien explaining all but the explanation as if we a ciphered letter’s cipher hit and find it in an unknown language writ he that goes back does since he goes advance though he doth not advance who goeth back and he that seeks though he on nothing chance may still by words be said to find a lack this paradox of having that is nought in the world’s meaning of the things it screens is yet true of the substance of pure thought and there means something by the nought it means for thinking nought does on nought being confer as giving not is acting not to give and to the same unbribed true thought to err is to find truth though by its negative so why call this world false if false to be be to be aught and being aught being to be happy the maimed the halt the mad the blind all who stamped separate by curtailing birth owe no duty’s allegiance to mankind nor stand a valuing in their scheme of worth but i whom fate not nature did curtail by no exterior voidness being exempt must bear accusing glances where i fail fixed in the general orbit of contempt fate less than nature in being kind to lacking giving the ill shows not as outer cause making our mockfree will the mirror’s backing which fate’s own acts as if in itself shows and men like children seeing the image there take place for cause and make our will fate bear good i have done my heart weighs i am sad the outer day void statue of lit blue is altogether outward other glad at mere being noti so my aches construe i that have failed in everything bewail nothing this hour but that i have bewailed for in the general fate what is’t to fail why fate being past for fate ’tis but to have failed whatever hapor stop what matters it sith to the mattering our will bringeth nought with the higher trifling let us world our wit conscious that if we do’t that was the lot the regular stars bound us to when they stood godfathers to our birth and to our blood as a blown leaf across the face of time your name falls emptily upon my heart in this new symmetry you have no part no lot in my fair life the stars still chime autumn and spring in ceaseless pantomime i play with beauty which is kin to art forgetting nature nor do pulses start to hear your soul remembered in a rhyme you may not vex me any more the stark terror of life has passed and all the stress winds had their will of me and now caress blown from bland groves i know time dreams and i as on a mirror see the days go by in nonchalant procession to the dark _chaque baiser vaut un roman_ i living love and laughter have forgot the way the heart has uttered melody as sobbing plaintive cadence of the sea a poet's soul should rest remembering not the inland paths of green the flowers the spot where fairies ring in hermit ecstasy music is born and gay or wofully lovers of poesy share her lonely lot for you and me beloved crowned with spring catching love's flowers from off the lap of time what are the songs my voice has scorned to sing ghostly they hover round my heartwise lips into a kiss i fold my rose of rhyme laid like a martyr on your fingertips as a pale child hemmed in by windy rain patiently turns to touch his wellknown toys playing as children play who make no noise yet happy in a way then sighs again to watch the world across the stormdim pane and sees with wistful eyes glad girls and boys who romp beneath the rain's unlicensed joys and feels wild longings sweep his gentle brain so i contented with my flowers for stars stroll in my fair walled garden happily knowing no gladder game till shrill and sweet i hear life's cry ring down the silent street and press my face against the sunlit bars to watch the joyous spirits who are free ah love have pityi am but a child i ask but light and laughter and the tears darken the sunlight of my fairest years by love made desolate by love beguiled i waste the spring love's harvest wains are piled with poppies and gold graini glean but fears of empty hands grim hunger and the jeers of happy wives whose loves are reconciled but mine ah mine is like a tattered leaf upon a turbid stream i have no pride no life but love which is a bitter grief as a lost star i wander down your sky give me your heart open it wideso wide i must have love and laughter or i die upon your stone the wine of my desire is spilled your poppy lips have grown too pale from fasting your white hands will not avail the cold eyes of your heart to light the fire i did not think my prayers could ever tire now like doomed ships they flutter without sail lost in a calm which held no rock no gale now when your chilly smile bids me aspire so without history my soul is slain woman of barren love the wine was red beautiful for your spending not again will the bud blossom where the frost has sped timid you dared not hark when angels sang all all is lost without one saving pang better than life better than sea and morn and all the sunstained fragments of the day ah more than breeze than purple clouds that stray across dim twilightsi the tempesttorn fighting the stars for glory who must scorn heartdrops bespread along love's cruel way like scattered petals on the breast of may better than life i love you i forlorn better than deaththe sleeping and the peace when warm within the breast of brooding earth my weary heart should give its woes release the pitiful dark remembering not my loss the calm wise years restoring joy for dearth better than death my love my burning cross out of the purple treasuries of night came the dark wind of evening silverstarred stirred on his cheek the forest keeping ward breathed with a tremulous silence and the bright bare moon crowned his adoring brow with light the exquisite dream of beauty held him hard in a great love a forest love unmarred still unprofanedby human nature's sight guarding the temple gates of peace he stood statue of bronze with pagan heart of stone sudden a dazzling glory lit the wood moon in his soul that dimmed the moon above life was revealed a springsweet maid alone beauty was woman and the womanlove as one who looks too long upon the sun when he must turn to earth from flameshot skies sees all else dark through his bereaved eyes and yet may watch the rainbow ribbons run athwart the gravity of gray and dun he holds the darkness dearer for the prize wherein his only pledge of radiance lies when he the vast magnificence must shun so we who play with rainbows having seen the sun's own face we may not hold the west which burns against the bosom of the night but in the afterglow with eyes serene we still may find dear heart the sun's bequest an echoed glory of our passionate light how we would live we'd drink the years like wine with all tomorrows hid behind the veil which is your hair between two lilies pale your slender handsmy heart should lie and shine a crimson rose we'd catch the wind and twine the evening starsa chaplet musical to crown our folly lure the nightingale to sing the bliss your lips should teach to mine and if the sage declaring life is vain should frown upon the flower of all our days and chide the sun that knows no tears of rain he should not tease our heart with cynic eye the soul's vast altar stands beyond his gaze when two have livedthen shall they fear to die nay touch me not nor even with your eyes hold mine for i would speak you thus afar aloof and chill and lonely as a star the hands that urge the hungry heart that cries have wrapped my love with love's elusive lies the lips that burn have laid a ruddy scar against the truth that stands without the bar and blinded faith with passion's mysteries night holds a single moon day one desire her golden sun and life a love supreme wherein one moment poises crowned with fire white with the naked truth beyond control 'tis here my sun in love's last hour extreme i hold aloft my bare adoring soul if i might see you dead beloveddead your false eyes closed forever to the light your false smile stilled upon my aching sight if i might know that nevermore your head cruelly fair could lie upon the bed of my torn heart if i beheld the night free from your living thoughtah if i might then could my desolate soul be comforted for this is worst of all the woes you gave my heart may not forgive the tired years go and leave the great love weeping for a grave scorned and unburied 'neath the open sky i could not love you less to see you so loving you more i might forgiveand die dear did we meet in some dim yesterday i half remember how the birds were mute among green leaves and tuliptinted fruit and on the grass beside a stream we lay in early twilight faintly far away came lovely sounds adrift from silver lute with answered echoes of an airy flute while twilight waited tiptoe fain to stay her violet eyes were sweet with mystery you looked in mine the music rose and fell like little lisping laughter of the sea our souls were barks windwafted from the shore gold cup a rose a ruby who can tell softmusic ceasesi recall no more i died today and yet upon my eyes a glamour of the gorgeous summer green still wavers and my brain has kept a keen sweet birdsong glad with light the summer skies are sapphire and a purple shadow lies across the hillsno change is on the scene since happy yesterday ah can it mean the body lives when stricken spirit dies the blow has fallen yet i can recall the first of days when this dead heart drew breath a wondrous moonflower waking of a heart strangethen as now the moment seemed to part body from soul so like are birth and death so did i gain and so i lost my all the lights within the icefloes are our flowers lily and daffodil and violet beneath these monstrous suns that never set tremble soft rainbows young as earth's first hours ancient as time no balm of gentle showers make for their growth for them gigantic met the immemorial ice and sun to get such blossomspledge of beauty's bravest powers violet and pale grassgreen the springtime dies in the soft south to us in this grim world daring with frozen heart and tearless eyes the north's white sanctity fate idly throws these almsa deathless spring of ice enfurled and over all far flung the sunset rose i can believe that my beloved dies that all her virtue all her youth shall fail and life her rosy life grow cold and pale to bloom again in braver paradise i must believe that death shall close her eyes and hold her heart beyond a heavy veil where silences surround her spirit frail and waste the form where all my loving lies ah god but no and is my love so weak her heart may pause may falter and grow still but not her laugh the color in her cheek that may not fade the catch that lifts her breath sobbing against my heart essay your will these are too dear to fill _your_ grave o death when one has heard the message of the rose for what faint other calling shall he care dark broodings turn to find their lonely lair the vain world keeps her posturing and pose he with his crimson secret which bestows heaven on his heart to heaven lifts his prayer and knows all glory trembling through the air as on triumphal journeying he goes so through green woodlands in the twilight dim led by the faint pale argent of a star what though to others it is weary night nature holds out her wide sweet heart to him and leaning o'er the world's mysterious bar his soul is great with everlasting light first came the tempest and the world was torn upon its mighty passionall the deep trembled before it from the haggard steep to the sweet valley with its brooding corn its foaming lips in expletives of scorn lashed into life the world's eternal sleep then caught with madness in gigantic leap expired upon the heights where it was born and then a hushthe dripping tender rain falls in warm tears the thunder could not wake the grief that silence in her soul has furled soft sighs the wind the sea is gray with pain the fulness of a heart too tense to break and deep unuttered sadness in the world the country road at lonely close of day rests for a while from the long stress of rain dripping and bowed the green walls of the lane reflect no glistening light no colors gay has dying summer left the sky is gray as though the weeping had not eased the pain the autumn is not yet and all in vain seems summer's lifea blossom cast away the air is hushed save in the emerald shade the rain still drips and stirs each fretting leaf to soft insistence of its little grief the hopeless calm all thought of life denies but hark out through the silence unafraid a robin ripples to the chilly skies not through this door of elemental calm patient wet woodland resting after rain brooding brown fields that wait the sleeping grain not through this door may the wrecked spirit's balm come in and take possession there's a psalm nature has crooned to weariness and pain easing the tumult of the worldworn brain sweet wholesome mother of the open palm but the disastrous heart cries out for men strife where the fight is reddest verily peace comes with fighting with the strength of ten here where the world is young with naught to see but day blow out across the long low sky peace means an emptiness which rests to die all my dead roses now i lay them here shrined in a beryl cup the mysteries of their sweet hauntings and their witcheries are not more subtle than this jewel clear are not more cold and dead the winter's spear has fallen on their heart a heart so wise with lore of love dead roses beauty lies hid in a perfume still supremely dear roses of love time killed you one by one laughed at my pains as sad i gathered up all the fair petals banished from the sun witness my triumphhow the dead loves bless lifefrom my heart which is their beryl cup crowning the winter of my loneliness how shall i hold you by a scimitar of flashing wit suspended o'er your head oh my beloved or with lips rosered lure you to lethe shall i stand afar pale and remote and distant as a star challenging love or by a scarlet thread jealousy's wiles beguile by scorn and dread wounding the heart i love with hateful scar nay i can take no action play no play all my wit falters when i hear you speak all my wise guile with which your wooing strove vanishes as the sun of yesterday i can but lay my cheek against your cheek love me or leave me i can only love take all of me pour out my life as wine to dye your soul's sweet shallows violent sin blazed me a path and i have walked therein strong unashamed your timorous hands need mine as the white stars their sky your lips' pale line shall blush to roses where my lips have been i ask no more i do not hope to win only to add myself to your design take all of me i know your little lies your light dishonor gentle treacheries i know i lie in torment at your feet shadow to all your sun take me and go use my adoring to your honor sweet strength for your weaknessit is better so the pale and misty particles of time hover about us scarce our eyes can see youth's faroff dream of what we were to be life's truth which once we would redeem with rhyme has proved instead a worldworn pantomime the running river of expediency has drowned the hopes that fortune held in fee why fall upon the track so many climb why strive to speak what all the earth has heard why labor at a work the ages plan life has been lived so oftan outworn thing then hark the timesweet carol of a bird new as a flower and seeah shame to man the endless aspiration of the spring the full throat of the world is charged with song morning and twilight melt with ecstasy in the high heat of noon simply to be palpitant where the green spring forces throng eager for life life unashamed and strong this is desire fulfilled exalted free the spirit gains her ether scornfully denies existence that is dark or wrong this is enough to see the song begun which shall be finished in some field afar laugh that the night may still contain a star nor idly moan your impotence of grace life is a song lift up your carefree face gladly and gratefully toward the sun he gives me happiness as flowers depend on loyal sun and shower i look to love to give me life why is it not enough divine contentment stretching without end o'er happy meadows he's my love my friend and peace is in the word youheart's despair sweep like a tempest through my sunsweet air wail like a lost soul through my blossomed grove tempest and calm with him my heart might rest lulled by eternal spring the dream is blest yet the wild grapes you crush make life divine out in the pathless dark all yours i go brave with the purple promise of the wine you you i love because you bring me woe and if i came ah if i came again and laid my hand on your forgetful heart where once it lay so warm could the pulse start remembering spring now at the sound of rain i do but turn a little in disdain to see the flowers renew their lovely part blooming afresh for memory holds no smart love aches no more to know how it was slain yet if i came to you who heed no more my name upon the wind love's ghost lean near i have a word that only you may hear if you should come to me with dear desire my soul's dry staff should tremble to its core and flame against your touch in buds of fire what shall i give to her who will not care if i give soul or roses will not know how that for sweets she'll spend light smiles she'll sow i will reap bitter tears if she could wear those tears as stars to sparkle in her hair what shall i give i have not fall'n so low i may not lay one gift before i go upon the altar of my heart's despair she will not know yet in my love a king i must be worthy of my crown and throne and so can sacrifice no little thing my life my soul are worthless since her scorn slay we then love on love's red altarstone beggared of all i face the world forlorn not you nor all the gauds that fate bestows can make me swerve so little from my dream across my veil of mystery you seem perhaps a little dearer than the rose perhaps more fair than the long light that flows between the lids of twilight but the gleam of iris on the breast of wisdom's stream is of a radiance that no rival knows my heart is not my heart or it might chance to sorrow for the sorrow in your tears my soul is locked against all circumstance of life or love or death or heaven or hell i have no place for laughter in my years no room where little little love might dwell the pattern of the earth so wonderful is more than myrtle very dear to me across the avenue of limes i see a little mist by ghosts made magical tossing across the hills more beautiful than the deep eyes of amber women free of shame and of disdain on some far sea swept by tradewinds the sun makes lyrical there is no air the mind may not recall blown from the violetbeds of greece and all the moons who drop their shattered petals here live from the days which hid semiramis breezes upon my lips are subtly dear because they bear the burden of her kiss the beggar thoughts pass down the lanes of day and on the thorns that are the hours i find their tatters and their rags infirm and blind they faded in the void and all the way mouthed senseless jeers at me i dared not pray for wisdom from these fools who throng the mind and leave no gifts but bitterness behind chin upon hand i watched nor bade them stay then wearily and indolently glanced where the thorns fluttered with their flags and lo fragments of cloth of silver gleamed and danced in the late sun and linen white as snow among the beggar thoughts with lowered eyes princes and kings had wandered in disguise i thought once how theocritus had sung of the sweet years the dear and wishedfor years who each one in a gracious hand appears to bear a gift for mortals old or young and as i mused it in his antique tongue i saw in gradual vision through my tears the sweet sad years the melancholy years those of my own life who by turns had flung a shadow across me straightway i was 'ware so weeping how a mystic shape did move behind me and drew me backward by the hair and a voice said in mastery while i strove guess now who holds theedeath i said but there the silver answer rang not death but love but only three in all god's universe have heard this word thou hast saidhimself beside thee speaking and me listening and replied one of us that was god and laid the curse so darkly on my eyelids as to amerce my sight from seeing theethat if i had died the deathweights placed there would have signified less absolute exclusion nay is worse from god than from all others o my friend men could not part us with their worldly jars nor the seas change us nor the tempests bend our hands would touch for all the mountainbars and heaven being rolled between us at the end we should but vow the faster for the stars unlike are we unlike o princely heart unlike our uses and our destinies our ministering two angels look surprise on one another as they strike athwart their wings in passing thou bethink thee art a guest for queens to social pageantries with gages from a hundred brighter eyes than tears even can make mine to play thy part of chief musician what hast thou to do with looking from the latticelights at me a poor tired wandering singer singing through the dark and leaning up a cypress tree the chrism is on thine headon mine the dew and death must dig the level where these agree thou hast thy calling to some palacefloor most gracious singer of high poems where the dancers will break footing from the care of watching up thy pregnant lips for more and dost thou lift this house's latch too poor for hand of thine and canst thou think and bear to let thy music drop here unaware in folds of golden fulness at my door look up and see the casement broken in the bats and owlets builders in the roof my cricket chirps against thy mandolin hush call no echo up in further proof of desolation there's a voice within that weeps as thou must sing alone aloof i lift my heavy heart up solemnly as once electra her sepulchral urn and looking in thine eyes i overturn the ashes at thy feet behold and see what a great heap of grief lay hid in me and how the red wild sparkles dimly burn through the ashen greyness if thy foot in scorn could tread them out to darkness utterly it might be well perhaps but if instead thou wait beside me for the wind to blow the grey dust up those laurels on thine head o my beloved will not shield thee so that none of all the fires shall scorch and shred the hair beneath stand further off then go go from me yet i feel that i shall stand henceforward in thy shadow nevermore alone upon the threshold of my door of individual life i shall command the uses of my soul nor lift my hand serenely in the sunshine as before without the sense of that which i forbore thy touch upon the palm the widest land doom takes to part us leaves thy heart in mine with pulses that beat double what i do and what i dream include thee as the wine must taste of its own grapes and when i sue god for myself he hears that name of thine and sees within my eyes the tears of two the face of all the world is changed i think since first i heard the footsteps of thy soul move still oh still beside me as they stole betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink of obvious death where i who thought to sink was caught up into love and taught the whole of life in a new rhythm the cup of dole god gave for baptism i am fain to drink and praise its sweetness sweet with thee anear the names of country heaven are changed away for where thou art or shalt be there or here and this this lute and song loved yesterday the singing angels know are only dear because thy name moves right in what they say what can i give thee back o liberal and princely giver who hast brought the gold and purple of thine heart unstained untold and laid them on the outside of the wall for such as i to take or leave withal in unexpected largesse am i cold ungrateful that for these most manifold high gifts i render nothing back at all not so not coldbut very poor instead ask god who knows for frequent tears have run the colours from my life and left so dead and pale a stuff it were not fitly done to give the same as pillow to thy head go farther let it serve to trample on can it be right to give what i can give to let thee sit beneath the fall of tears as salt as mine and hear the sighing years resighing on my lips renunciative through those infrequent smiles which fail to live for all thy adjurations o my fears that this can scarce be right we are not peers so to be lovers and i own and grieve that givers of such gifts as mine are must be counted with the ungenerous out alas i will not soil thy purple with my dust nor breathe my poison on thy veniceglass nor give thee any lovewhich were unjust beloved i only love thee let it pass yet love mere love is beautiful indeed and worthy of acceptation fire is bright let temple burn or flax an equal light leaps in the flame from cedarplank or weed and love is fire and when i say at need i love thee mark i love theein thy sight i stand transfigured glorified aright with conscience of the new rays that proceed out of my face toward thine there's nothing low in love when love the lowest meanest creatures who love god god accepts while loving so and what i feel across the inferior features of what i am doth flash itself and show how that great work of love enhances nature's and therefore if to love can be desert i am not all unworthy cheeks as pale as these you see and trembling knees that fail to bear the burden of a heavy heart this weary minstrellife that once was girt to climb aornus and can scarce avail to pipe now 'gainst the valley nightingale a melancholy musicwhy advert to these things o beloved it is plain i am not of thy worth nor for thy place and yet because i love thee i obtain from that same love this vindicating grace to live on still in love and yet in vain to bless thee yet renounce thee to thy face indeed this very love which is my boast and which when rising up from breast to brow doth crown me with a ruby large enow to draw men's eyes and prove the inner cost this love even all my worth to the uttermost i should not love withal unless that thou hadst set me an example shown me how when first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed and love called love and thus i cannot speak of love even as a good thing of my own thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak and placed it by thee on a golden throne and that i love o soul we must be meek is by thee only whom i love alone and wilt thou have me fashion into speech the love i bear thee finding words enough and hold the torch out while the winds are rough between our faces to cast light on each i drop it at thy feet i cannot teach my hand to hold my spirits so far off from myselfmethat i should bring thee proof in words of love hid in me out of reach nay let the silence of my womanhood commend my womanlove to thy belief seeing that i stand unwon however wooed and rend the garment of my life in brief by a most dauntless voiceless fortitude lest one touch of this heart convey its grief if thou must love me let it be for nought except for love's sake only do not say i love her for her smileher lookher way of speaking gentlyfor a trick of thought that falls in well with mine and certes brought a sense of pleasant ease on such a day for these things in themselves beloved may be changed or change for theeand love so wrought may be unwrought so neither love me for thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry a creature might forget to weep who bore thy comfort long and lose thy love thereby but love me for love's sake that evermore thou may'st love on through love's eternity accuse me not beseech thee that i wear too calm and sad a face in front of thine for we two look two ways and cannot shine with the same sunlight on our brow and hair on me thou lookest with no doubting care as on a bee shut in a crystalline since sorrow hath shut me safe in love's divine and to spread wing and fly in the outer air were most impossible failure if i strove to fail so but i look on theeon thee beholding besides love the end of love hearing oblivion beyond memory as one who sits and gazes from above over the rivers to the bitter sea and yet because thou overcomest so because thou art more noble and like a king thou canst prevail against my fears and fling thy purple round me till my heart shall grow too close against thine heart henceforth to know how it shook when alone why conquering may prove as lordly and complete a thing in lifting upward as in crushing low and as a vanquished soldier yields his sword to one who lifts him from the bloody earth even so beloved i at last record here ends my strife if thou invite me forth i rise above abasement at the word make thy love larger to enlarge my worth my poet thou canst touch on all the notes god set between his after and before and strike up and strike off the general roar of the rushing worlds a melody that floats in a serene air purely antidotes of medicated music answering for mankind's forlornest uses thou canst pour from thence into their ears god's will devotes thine to such ends and mine to wait on thine how dearest wilt thou have me for most use a hope to sing by gladly or a fine sad memory with thy songs to interfuse a shade in which to singof palm or pine a grave on which to rest from singing choose i never gave a lock of hair away to a man dearest except this to thee which now upon my fingers thoughtfully i ring out to the full brown length and say take it my day of youth went yesterday my hair no longer bounds to my foot's glee nor plant i it from rose or myrtletree as girls do any more it only may now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears taught drooping from the head that hangs aside through sorrow's trick i thought the funeralshears would take this first but love is justified take it thoufinding pure from all those years the kiss my mother left here when she died the soul's rialto hath its merchandize i barter curl for curl upon that mart and from my poet's forehead to my heart receive this lock which outweighs argosies as purply black as erst to pindar's eyes the dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart the nine white musebrows for this counterpart  the bay crown's shade beloved i surmise still lingers on thy curl it is so black thus with a fillet of smoothkissing breath i tie the shadows safe from gliding back and lay the gift where nothing hindereth here on my heart as on thy brow to lack no natural heat till mine grows cold in death beloved my beloved when i think that thou wast in the world a year ago what time i sat alone here in the snow and saw no footprint heard the silence sink no moment at thy voice but link by link went counting all my chains as if that so they never could fall off at any blow struck by thy possible handwhy thus i drink of life's great cup of wonder wonderful never to feel thee thrill the day or night with personal act or speechnor ever cull some prescience of thee with the blossoms white thou sawest growing atheists are as dull who cannot guess god's presence out of sight say over again and yet once over again that thou dost love me though the word repeated should seem a cuckoosong as thou dost treat it remember never to the hill or plain valley and wood without her cuckoostrain comes the fresh spring in all her green completed beloved i amid the darkness greeted by a doubtful spiritvoice in that doubt's pain cry speak once morethou lovest who can fear too many stars though each in heaven shall roll too many flowers though each shall crown the year say thou dost love me love me love metoll the silver iteranceonly minding dear to love me also in silence with thy soul when our two souls stand up erect and strong face to face silent drawing nigh and nigher until the lengthening wings break into fire at either curved pointwhat bitter wrong can the earth do to us that we should not long be here contented think in mounting higher the angels would press on us and aspire to drop some golden orb of perfect song into our deep dear silence let us stay rather on earth belovedwhere the unfit contrarious moods of men recoil away and isolate pure spirits and permit a place to stand and love in for a day with darkness and the deathhour rounding it is it indeed so if i lay here dead wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine and would the sun for thee more coldly shine because of gravedamps falling round my head i marvelled my beloved when i read thy thought so in the letter i am thine but so much to thee can i pour thy wine while my hands tremble then my soul instead of dreams of death resumes life's lower range then love me love look on mebreathe on me as brighter ladies do not count it strange for love to give up acres and degree i yield the grave for thy sake and exchange my near sweet view of heaven for earth with thee let the world's sharpness like a clasping knife shut in upon itself and do no harm in this close hand of love now soft and warm and let us hear no sound of human strife after the click of the shutting life to life i lean upon thee dear without alarm and feel as safe as guarded by a charm against the stab of worldlings who if rife are weak to injure very whitely still the lilies of our lives may reassure their blossoms from their roots accessible alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer growing straight out of man's reach on the hill god only who made us rich can make us poor a heavy heart beloved have i borne from year to year until i saw thy face and sorrow after sorrow took the place of all those natural joys as lightly worn as the stringed pearls each lifted in its turn by a beating heart at dancetime hopes apace were changed to long despairs till god's own grace could scarcely lift above the world forlorn my heavy heart then thou didst bid me bring and let it drop adown thy calmly great deep being fast it sinketh as a thing which its own nature does precipitate while thine doth close above it mediating betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate i lived with visions for my company instead of men and women years ago and found them gentle mates nor thought to know a sweeter music than they played to me but soon their trailing purple was not free of this world's dust their lutes did silent grow and i myself grew faint and blind below their vanishing eyes then thou didst cometo be beloved what they seemed their shining fronts their songs their splendours better yet the same as riverwater hallowed into fonts met in thee and from out thee overcame my soul with satisfaction of all wants because god's gifts put man's best dreams to shame my own beloved who hast lifted me from this drear flat of earth where i was thrown and in betwixt the languid ringlets blown a lifebreath till the forehead hopefully shines out again as all the angels see before thy saving kiss my own my own who camest to me when the world was gone and i who looked for only god found thee i find thee i am safe and strong and glad as one who stands in dewless asphodel looks backward on the tedious time he had in the upper lifeso i with bosomswell make witness here between the good and bad that love as strong as death retrieves as well my letters all dead paper mute and white and yet they seem alive and quivering against my tremulous hands which loose the string and let them drop down on my knee tonight this saidhe wished to have me in his sight once as a friend this fixed a day in spring to come and touch my hand a simple thing yet i wept for itthis the paper's light  said dear i love thee and i sank and quailed as if god's future thundered on my past this said i am thineand so its ink has paled with lying at my heart that beat too fast and this o love thy words have ill availed if what this said i dared repeat at last i think of theemy thoughts do twine and bud about thee as wild vines about a tree put out broad leaves and soon there's nought to see except the straggling green which hides the wood yet o my palmtree be it understood i will not have my thoughts instead of thee who art dearer better rather instantly renew thy presence as a strong tree should rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare and let these bands of greenery which insphere thee drop heavily downburst shattered everywhere because in this deep joy to see and hear thee and breathe within thy shadow a new air i do not think of theei am too near thee i see thine image through my tears tonight and yet today i saw thee smiling how refer the causebeloved is it thou or i who makes me sad the acolyte amid the chanted joy and thankful rite may so fall flat with pale insensate brow on the altarstair i hear thy voice and vow perplexed uncertain since thou art out of sight as he in his swooning ears the choir's amen beloved dost thou love or did i see all the glory as i dreamed and fainted when too vehement light dilated my ideal for my soul's eyes will that light come again as now these tears comefalling hot and real thou comest all is said without a word i sit beneath thy looks as children do in the noonsun with souls that tremble through their happy eyelids from an unaverred yet prodigal inward joy behold i erred in that last doubt and yet i cannot rue the sin most but the occasionthat we two should for a moment stand unministered by a mutual presence ah keep near and close thou dovelike help and when my fears would rise with thy broad heart serenely interpose brood down with thy divine sufficiencies these thoughts which tremble when bereft of those like callow birds left desert to the skies the first time that the sun rose on thine oath to love me i looked forward to the moon to slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon and quickly tied to make a lasting troth quickloving hearts i thought may quickly loathe and looking on myself i seemed not one for such man's lovemore like an outoftune worn viol a good singer would be wroth to spoil his song with and which snatched in haste is laid down at the first illsounding note i did not wrong myself so but i placed a wrong on thee for perfect strains may float 'neath masterhands from instruments defaced and great souls at one stroke may do and doat yes call me by my petname let me hear the name i used to run at when a child from innocent play and leave the cowslips plied to glance up in some face that proved me dear with the look of its eyes i miss the clear fond voices which being drawn and reconciled into the music of heaven's undefiled call me no longer silence on the bier while i call godcall godso let thy mouth be heir to those who are now exanimate gather the north flowers to complete the south and catch the early love up in the late yes call me by that nameand i in truth with the same heart will answer and not wait with the same heart i said i'll answer thee as those when thou shalt call me by my name lo the vain promise is the same the same perplexed and ruffled by life's strategy when called before i told how hastily i dropped my flowers or brake off from a game to run and answer with the smile that came at play last moment and went on with me through my obedience when i answer now i drop a grave thought break from solitude yet still my heart goes to theeponder how not as to a single good but all my good lay thy hand on it best one and allow that no child's foot could run fast as this blood if i leave all for thee wilt thou exchange and be all to me shall i never miss hometalk and blessing and the common kiss that comes to each in turn nor count it strange when i look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home than this nay wilt thou fill that place by me which is filled by dead eyes too tender to know change that's hardest if to conquer love has tried to conquer grief tries more as all things prove for grief indeed is love and grief beside alas i have grieved so i am hard to love yet love mewilt thou open thy heart wide and fold within the wet wings of thy dove when we met first and loved i did not build upon the event with marble could it mean to last a love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow nay i rather thrilled distrusting every light that seemed to gild the onward path and feared to overlean a finger even and though i have grown serene and strong since then i think that god has willed a still renewable fear o love o troth  lest these enclasped hands should never hold this mutual kiss drop down between us both as an unowned thing once the lips being cold and love be false if he to keep one oath must lose one joy by his life's star foretold pardon oh pardon that my soul should make of all that strong divineness which i know for thine and thee an image only so formed of the sand and fit to shift and break it is that distant years which did not take thy sovranty recoiling with a blow have forced my swimming brain to undergo their doubt and dread and blindly to forsake thy purity of likeness and distort thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit as if a shipwrecked pagan safe in port his guardian seagod to commemorate should set a sculptured porpoise gills asnort and vibrant tail within the templegate first time he kissed me he but only kissed the fingers of this hand wherewith i write and ever since it grew more clean and white slow to worldgreetings quick with its o list when the angels speak a ring of amethyst i could not wear here plainer to my sight than that first kiss the second passed in height the first and sought the forehead and half missed half falling on the hair o beyond meed that was the chrism of love which love's own crown with sanctifying sweetness did precede the third upon my lips was folded down in perfect purple state since when indeed i have been proud and said my love my own because thou hast the power and own'st the grace to look through and behind this mask of me against which years have beat thus blanchingly with their rains and behold my soul's true face the dim and weary witness of life's race because thou hast the faith and love to see through that same soul's distracting lethargy the patient angel waiting for a place in the new heavensbecause nor sin nor woe nor god's infliction nor death's neighbourhood nor all which others viewing turn to go nor all which makes me tired of all selfviewed nothing repels thee dearest teach me so to pour out gratitude as thou dost good oh yes they love through all this world of ours i will not gainsay love called love forsooth i have heard love talked in my early youth and since not so long back but that the flowers then gathered smell still mussulmans and giaours throw kerchiefs at a smile and have no ruth for any weeping polypheme's white tooth slips on the nut if after frequent showers the shell is oversmoothand not so much will turn the thing called love aside to hate or else to oblivion but thou art not such a lover my beloved thou canst wait through sorrow and sickness to bring souls to touch and think it soon when others cry too late i thank all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine deep thanks to all who paused a little near the prisonwall to hear my music in its louder parts ere they went onward each one to the mart's or temple's occupation beyond call but thou who in my voice's sink and fall when the sob took it thy divinest art's own instrument didst drop down at thy foot to harken what i said between my tears  instruct me how to thank thee oh to shoot my soul's full meaning into future years that they should lend it utterance and salute love that endures from life that disappears my future will not copy fair my past i wrote that once and thinking at my side my ministering lifeangel justified the word by his appealing look upcast to the white throne of god i turned at last and there instead saw thee not unallied to angels in thy soul then i long tried by natural ills received the comfort fast while budding at thy sight my pilgrim's staff gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled i seek no copy now of life's first half leave here the pages with long musing curled and write me new my future's epigraph new angel mine unhoped for in the world how do i love thee let me count the ways i love thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach when feeling out of sight for the ends of being and ideal grace i love thee to the level of everyday's most quiet need by sun and candlelight i love thee freely as men strive for right i love thee purely as they turn from praise i love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhood's faith i love thee with a love i seemed to lose with my lost saintsi love thee with the breath smiles tears of all my lifeand if god choose i shall but love thee better after death beloved thou hast brought me many flowers plucked in the garden all the summer through and winter and it seemed as if they grew in this close room nor missed the sun and showers so in the like name of that love of ours take back these thoughts which here unfolded too and which on warm and cold days i withdrew from my heart's ground indeed those beds and bowers be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue and wait thy weeding yet here's eglantine here's ivytake them as i used to do thy flowers and keep them where they shall not pine instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true and tell thy soul their roots are left in mine
